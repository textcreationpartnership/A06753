            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Moreouer, to free the Proteſtant readers minde before hand from obſtinacy, three points are proued euen out of writers of the newe religion: firſt, that more of the ſaid religion condemne euery particular perſons beliefe of that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then approue it; ſecondly, that manifest truthes are denied and falſhoods mainetained by the chiefe ſectaries; laſtly, that according to the confeſsion of the ſame Authours, our religion and faith is true, theirs falſe.</p>

Our principal endeauour in this vvorld ought to be, to erect in our ſoules a towre or ſpiritual edifice of vertue, the ground of vvhich edifice is faith; and ſuch is the miſery of theſe our daies,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12.</note> that diuers perſons are ſo farre from building <hi>vpon this foundation gold, ſiluer, or pretious ſtones,</hi> that they doe nothing elſe but alwaies buſie themſelues about the ſaid foundation: my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that they ſo occupy or rather vexe themſelues continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in diſcuſſing matters concerning their beliefe, that they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19127:4"/>
remaine alwaies wauering without any ſure ground of faith, or at the leaſt if not altogether, verily for the moſt part wholy neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their ſpiritual progreſſe in vertues of higher perfection. In which their manner of proceeding I ſay, they cannot be cenſured leſſe faulty then he, who conſumeth the whole courſe of his life in laying the foundation of a houſe or ſumptuous pallace, and neuer goeth or ſeeketh to goe ſo farre as to build the walles or any other part of the ſame. Nay, the firſt muſt needs be deemed much more faulty then this fond builder, becauſe their edifice is of greater importance, then the ſetting vp of any ſuch material houſe or pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</p>
            <p>I intend not hereto ſhew by the authority of the holy Scripture, and the teſtimonies of the auncient Fathers (both which yeeld me moſt plentiful proofes in this matter) that faith is only the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not the whole cauſe of our juſtification; neither is there any great neede in this place of entering into any ſuch diſcourſe. For beſides that no man according to the rules of reaſon, can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme him a perfect Chriſtian, vvho doth only beleeue rightly without proceeding any further (becauſe certaine it is that faith of it ſelfe doth only perfect the vnderſtanding and not the vvil, and that a right vnderſtanding profiteth litle except the wil be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable it is euen as apparant;) moreouer, this aſſertion as far forth as it conduceth to my purpoſe, ſeemeth to be granted euen by our aduerſaries the followers of the newe religion. For they diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh eſpecially two ſorts of faith,<note place="margin">See part <hi>2.</hi> of this Treatiſe chap. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> the one they cal a <hi>faith hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> the other <hi>a faith juſtifying:</hi> the firſt they confound vvith that which we hold being joyned with hope and charity to juſtifie vs, and this they deny not to be the ground, not the vvhole cauſe of our juſtification (for this effect and prerogatiue they attribute to the ſecond of vvhich hereafter:) vvherefore, euen according to their doctrine the truth of that vvhich I haue auerred muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, it may be objected againſt it, that the miſteries and articles of our faith are diuers, &amp; aboue the reach of our natural reaſon; and therefore that a great time is requiſite to this, that the truth of euery one of them be throughly ſearched, &amp; a certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution concerning euery point ſetled. I anſwere, that this in very deede (if al be true which is taught by the ſaid followers of the new
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19127:4"/>
religion) cannot be denied: for they making the bare letter of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, the only rule and guide of their faith, muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in like ſort affirme, that no man can euer come to a certaine knowledge what is to be beleeued touching the articles of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except by diligent diſcuſſion he plainely and infallibly drawe the truth from the ſaid letter of holy Scripture; which if he could by any meanes compaſſe, yet he cannot doe, vnleſſe among other thinges he reade ouer the whole Bible, conferre one place vvith another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo in this ſtudy conſume almoſt al the daies of his life.</p>
            <p>But according to the truth, God who is goodneſſe it ſelfe, hath farre otherwiſe and better prouided for thoſe that are deſirous to ſerue him, and more richly to adorne their ſoules with vertue. For he hath ordained a viſible guide indued vvith life and reaſon, and therefore apt to inſtruct and judge, vvhoſe doctrine and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he hath warranted from errour and falſehood; of whome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery perſon vvith diuine aſſurance of truth, in a very ſhort time may perfectly be taught what he is to beleeue. For the better ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of this, he hath alſo left in her ſacred boſome other more particuler but diuine and infallible grounds, beſides his holy writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word, whereby we are to be directed in faith. And this guide is our holy mother the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church, the ſacred ſpouſe of Chriſt and his miſtical body.</p>
            <p>Now therefore to proceed in mine intended diſcourſe, becauſe it behoueth euery man (as appeareth by that which hath bin alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid) with al ſpeed to order that his beliefe be right, and likewiſe becauſe this may ſoone be learned of the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church; hence it proceedeth, that no treatiſes touching controuerſies of religion are commonly more neceſſary, then ſuch as declare what congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or company of Chriſtians are the ſaid one, holy, <hi>Catholike</hi> and Apoſtolike Church, proue her diuine authority, or ſhew what particuler groundes are found in her, by which euery perſon is to be guided in his beliefe. The reaſon of this is plaine, becauſe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer recurreth to this Church and theſe groundes, may ſoone and with great eaſe be reſolued concerning al articles vvhatſoeuer to him ſeeming doubtful; whereas if neglecting theſe he betake him to the ſtudy of particular controuerſies, as of juſtification, free wil, merit of good workes, the real preſence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he may ſpend
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19127:5"/>
many daies and nights, and be nothing the nearer to a ſetled and ſure reſolution. Nay, ſome of theſe and other points are ſo high and difficult, that without recourſe to ſome general groundes, and the authority of the Church directing al Chriſtians, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that by other meanes, a man ſhould euer aſſure himſelfe that he is in the truth.</p>
            <p>Neither is this the opinion only of <hi>Catholikes,</hi> but alſo of ſome learned <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> And among others <hi>M. Field,</hi> eſteemed by ſome one of the greateſt ſchollars of their company,<note place="margin">Richard Field in the beginning of his Epistle Dedicatory before his fiue bookes of the Church.</note> writeth thus: <hi>The conſideration of the vnhappy diuiſions of the Chriſtian world, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſtractions of mens mindes, not knowing in ſo great variety of opinions, what to thinke, or to whome to joine themſelues (euery faction boaſting of the pure and ſincere profeſsion of heauenly truth, challenging to it ſelfe alone the name of the Church, and faſtning vpon al that diſſent, or are otherwiſe minded, the hateful note of ſchiſme and hereſie) hath made me euer thinke, that there is no part of heauenly knowledge more neceſſary, then that which concerneth the Church. For ſeing that controuerſies of religion in our time are growen in number ſo many, and in nature ſo intricate, that few haue time and leaſure, fewer ſtrength and vnderſtanding to examine them; what remaineth for men deſirous of ſatisfaction in thinges of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but diligently to ſearch out, which amongſt al the ſocieties of men in the world, is that bleſſed company of holy ones, that houſe-hold of faith, that ſpouſe of Christ, and Church of the liuing God, which is the pillar and ground of truth? that ſo they may embrace her communion, followe her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and reſt in her judgement. Hence it commeth that al wiſe and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious men, doe more eſteeme bookes of doctrinal principles, then thoſe that are written of any other argument; and that there was neuer any treaſure holden more rich and pretious by al them that knewe howe to price and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue thinges aright, thou bookes of preſcriptions against</hi> Heretikes: <hi>for that thereby, men that are not willing or not able to examine the infinite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that ariſe among men concerning the faith, haue general directions what to followe, and what to auoide:</hi> Hitherto are <hi>M. Fields</hi> vvordes. And like as this <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctor yeeldeth this reaſon among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for the publication of his bookes of the Church: ſo in very truth, the ſame motiue hath partly moued me to publiſh ſome of my labours to the viewe of the world. We <hi>Catholikes</hi> haue a long time wiſhed and endeauoured, to bring the controuerſies of theſe times to certaine <hi>general groundes</hi> and <hi>doctrinal principles,</hi> and haue

Some fewe yeares ſince a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19127:6"/>
               <hi>Catholike</hi> gentleman being entred into ſome communication with a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> miniſter, requeſted me to ſet him downe ſome briefe reaſons for the <hi>Catholike</hi> part, vpon vvhich he might ſtand: I did ſo, and I comprehended ſome twelue reaſons in ſome three ſheets of paper, vvhich al vvere drawne from general groundes and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal principles. Not very long after, I giuing my ſelfe alwaies to the ſtudy of controuerſies, and hauing no learned friend at hand with whome I might conferre, the more to perfect my ſelfe in ſuch kinde of arguments (vvhich vvithout conference or vvriting can hardly be done) it came into my minde to enlarge my ſelfe much more vpon the ſaid reaſons. And truly, ſo much matter occurred vnto me being buſied in theſe exerciſes, that I thought it meete to deuide my twelue reaſons into two treatiſes: of vvhich, the one I called a treatiſe of the groundes of the old and newe religion, the other a treatiſe of the definition and notes of the Church. Hauing finiſhed the firſt, I communicated it to ſome one or two of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar friends, who were deſirous to ſee it; and ſo by ſome meanes it came to the ſight of ſome perſons eſteemed learned and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who thought it might profit many if it were more common, and therefore were deſirous to haue it printed. This was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of my writing in this kinde, and thus the one of theſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes beſides my firſt intention or expectation, is nowe paſſed the print; I truſt without any raſh preſumption or boldnes in me, ſeing that I rather haue yeelded to the deſire and aduiſe of men thought to be of mature judgement, diſcretion, and learning, then for any other reſpect haue followed my owne fancy or inclination.</p>
            <p>Nowe, to giue my reader here a certaine taſte of the contents of that which I intend here to publiſh, as alſo of my manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeeding, I thinke it meete to aduertiſe him, that in it I haue prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally by apparant arguments proued two thinges: the one, that we <hi>Catholikes</hi> ground our faith and religion vpon the diuine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God, the other that our aduerſaries (I meane the newe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries) build their faith and religion (I take theſe vvordes in an ample ſignification) vpon their owne judgments. The firſt is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the firſt part, in which I haue ſhewed ſuch groundes as the <hi>Catholikes</hi> build on, to be of diuine authority: The ſecond in like ſort is conuinced to be true in the ſecond part, vvhere I haue declared euen to the eie, that the followers of the newe religion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19127:6"/>
reject al other ſuch groundes beſides the holy Scripture: vvhich alſo I haue proued them to reject and receiue, tranſlate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound not according to any diuine ground, but as it liketh their owne fancies; &amp; conſequently I haue demonſtrated, that in ſumme they haue no other foundation whereon they build, but this, that their beliefes ſeeme true to their owne natural reaſon.</p>
            <p>It may be demanded what proofes I vſe in theſe my diſcourſes. I anſwere in fewe vvordes, that I bring forth proofes out of the holy Scripture, I alleage the auncient Fathers and vvriters, ſuch as liued and wrote within the firſt ſixe hundred yeares after Chriſt, which ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> challenge to haue beene of their faith and religion, and therefore allowe of their teſtimonies: I cite moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the ſentences of diuers Sectaries of theſe our daies, vvho con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that to be true which I endeauour to proue, not the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> Libertines, <hi>Tritheiſts,</hi> Trinitarians, or of any others commonly by <hi>Proteſtants</hi> cenſured to be <hi>Heretikes;</hi> but of ſuch as are vſually by al ſorts accknowledged to be writers of their <hi>Proteſtant</hi> family, and members (as they ſay) of their reformed Churches. In alleaging of which ſentences of our aduerſaries, for the benefit of thoſe that vnderſtand not the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue, I haue obſerued this as much as I could, that I haue taken them out of bookes either written in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that ſo euery perſon might eaſily turne vnto them. Neither ought the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of ſuch ſectaries to be thought by any man a weake argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for what proofe almoſt, being not diuine, can be of greater force then the confeſſion of an aduerſary or enemy, touching the truth of that which is cenſured falſe by his doctors, and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of him whome he hateth and impugneth; or the falſehood of his owne chiefemaſters doctrine, and the guiltineſſe of himſelfe, or ſuch as he loueth, or are of his owne brotherhood? And hence it is, that <hi>M. Whitakers</hi> a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> of no meane fame,<note place="margin">Whitaker de Eccleſ. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſ. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>14.</hi> pag. <hi>366.</hi>
               </note> graunteth that argument to be ſtrong, which is drawne from the confeſſion of aduerſaries. Finally, ſometimes I bring forth ſome natural reaſons and congruences, prouing the conueniency of that which is auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. For we may wel aſſure our ſelues (ſo if I doe not forget my ſelfe ſaith <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi>) that God hath done vvhatſoeuer in right reaſon vve ſhal finde to be beſt. Theſe be the proofes of mine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, and others then theſe I ſeldome or neuer vſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:19127:7"/>But the better to declare my ſincere dealing herein, and alſo to ſhew the force of ſuch teſtimonies of auncient Authors as I alleage, I haue added before this treatiſe a table of al ſuch Councels extant as I finde celebrated within the ſaid firſt ſixe ages; as likewiſe of al the writers of thoſe times, which I finde to haue left any workes commonly alleaged in ſchooles to their poſterity. I haue moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer noted out of good and approued authors, the yeare in vvhich ſuch Councels were celebrated, and in which ſuch writers either flouriſhed or departed out of this world. Al theſe things I haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with as great ſincerity as the want of bookes hath ſuffered me. And in very deede I may truly proteſt, that willingly and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly I haue wronged no one writer in miſalleaging his wordes or meaning, be he <hi>Catholike,</hi> or be he <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> be he Auncient, or be he Moderne. It may be ſome faults haue eſcaped me, but againſt my wil. Neither doth our <hi>Catholike</hi> cauſe neede any ſuch jugling or falſe dealing, the truth is ſo manifeſt on our ſide, and the proofes of the ſame ſo many and pregnant.</p>
            <p>But before my reader enter into the viewing of theſe my diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that he may reape the greater profit of his labour, I muſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly craue one thing at his handes, to wit: that if he be of an other religion then is here defended, before hand he doe not harden his hart, and vvith obſtinacy determine not to change his opinion or practiſe, whatſoeuer he heare, reade, or vnderſtand ſaid againſt it, or in proofe of an other way. It behoueth euery Chriſtian to be of <hi>a right hart</hi> and <hi>a good wil.</hi> Much is ſaid in the holy Scripture, both in commendation of the one and of the other. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in the Pſalmes, often commendeth them that are <hi>recti corde, right in hart,</hi> and in particular inuiteth them to the praiſe of almighty God. The Angels at the birth of our Lord did ſing this Hymne:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 14.</note> 
               <hi>Gloria in altiſsimis Deo, &amp; in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis: Glory in the higheſt to God, and in earth peace to men of good wil.</hi> And who hath <hi>a right hart</hi> and is of <hi>good wil?</hi> Verily, he that doth not obdurate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt God, but is deſirous and by al meanes ſeeketh to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his wil to Gods wil, vvhich is the right and ſtraite rule, by vvhich al our thoughts and actions are to be ſquared and tried. Of my reader therefore if he be a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> I deſire no more, but that he bring his hart and wil to this diſpoſition, if it be not ſo diſpoſed already; that he be deſirous to ſerue God in his true Church, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19127:7"/>
caſting off al obſtinacy he be indifferent either to this or that, ſo that he might be throughly informed of the truth. Laſtly, that he humbly craue of God, that if his beliefe be not right, he wil merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vouchſafe to giue him grace and meanes vvhereby he may finde out the truth.</p>
            <p>And becauſe I eſteeme this diſpoſition in that <hi>Proteſtant</hi> vvhich intendeth to reade this Treatiſe, to be a matter of great moment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his conuerſion, I thinke it conuenient briefly here to touch among diuers others which occurre, ſome two motiues, which in my judgement are very ſufficient to drawe any man from obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the newe religion, yea be he of what ſect ſoeuer, to make him doubtful of the ſincerity of that faith and religion which he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. Of theſe the firſt ſhal be, that as many (I may ſay more) and as vertuous, and as learned euen of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ſide, condemne his ſaid faith and religion as erroneous, as there doe approue it as true. For if he be a <hi>Zwinglian,</hi> a <hi>Caluiniſt,</hi> or an <hi>Engliſh Proteſtant,</hi> although his temporal Magiſtrates and his learned Maſters tel him that he is of a ſound beliefe, and a true member of Chriſts Church, yet <hi>Luther</hi> and al the <hi>Lutherans</hi> affirme in plaine tearmes and that vvith great vehemency, neuertheleſſe deliberately and aduiſedly, that he is an <hi>Heretike;</hi> and conſequently, is guilty of that crime which the<note n="*" place="margin">Apologie of the Church of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part. <hi>1.</hi> pa. <hi>28. 29.</hi>

            <p>A ſecond reaſon or motiue, which is ſufficient to exclude obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy from the hart of any one of the followers of the newe religion, is; that al the learned and principal ſectaries as <hi>Luther,</hi> Zwinglius, <hi>Caluin</hi> &amp; others, haue notoriouſly and groſly erred in ſome points or other touching religious matters.

proue after this ſort: The <hi>Puritans</hi> in their <hi>Christian and modeſt offer</hi> (ſo they tearme it) <hi>of a most indifferent conference tendered</hi> not long ſince to the <hi>Proteſtant Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, and al their adherents,</hi> plainely affirme; that if their <hi>Puritan</hi> propoſitions be denied, and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> haue the truth on their ſide, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is the true Church of Chriſt. For hauing ſet downe ſuch <hi>propoſitions as they offer to mainetaine againſt the Proteſtants,</hi> among other <hi>just conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations</hi> (as they pretend) <hi>mouing them to make this offer</hi> in the <hi>ſixt</hi> place they aſſigne this for one.<note place="margin">A Chriſtian and modeſt of fer, &amp;c. pag. <hi>11.</hi> publiſhed anno <hi>1606.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Diuers of the aforeſaid propoſitions are ſuch</hi> (ſay they) <hi>that if the Miniſters ſhould not conſtantly hold and maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſame againſt al men, they cannot ſee howe poſsibly (by the rules of diuinity) the ſeperation of our Churches from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and from the</hi> Pope <hi>the ſupreame head thereof; can be juſtified.</hi> And againe in the <hi>eight</hi> conſideration, hauing yeelded an other reaſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>they cannot but make oppoſition to the Prelates, in approuing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions aboue ſpecified,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. <hi>16.</hi>
               </note> they adde: <hi>wherein if they</hi> (the <hi>Puritan</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who make this offer) <hi>be in errour, and the Prelates on the contrary haue the truth, they protest to al the world, that the</hi> Pope <hi>and the Church of</hi> Rome (<hi>and in them God and Christ</hi> IESVS <hi>himſelfe) haue great wrong and indignity offered vnto them, in that they are rejected, and that al the</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Churches are</hi> Schiſmatical <hi>in forſaking vnity and communion with them:</hi> Hitherto are the <hi>Puritans</hi> vvordes. Hence (vvhich is a point vvorthy to be noted) they promiſe their reconciliation vnto vs, if we can proue the falſhood of their aſſertions, which promiſe they make not to the <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants.</hi> For thus they goe on in the firſt place alleaged: <hi>And therefore for as much as in theſe controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, the</hi> Papiſts <hi>and the Prelates goe hand in hand, the ſaid Miniſters doe in like manner make the like offer to the</hi> Prieſtes <hi>and</hi> Ieſuites, <hi>promiſing their reconcilement vnto that See</hi> (of Rome) <hi>if they can either by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments pul them from the aforeſaid propoſitions, or can anſwere ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as they ſhal propound in the defence of them, in manner and forme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpecified in the offer. And therefore it both ſtands the Miniſters vpon to make the aforeſaid offer, and the Prelates (except they wil haue al the world to judge them to be friendes in hart to</hi> Popery) <hi>to accept of the ſame:</hi> Thus the <hi>Puritan</hi> Miniſters, and no ſuch offer that I finde through the whole booke is made to the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> This then is affirmed by theſe men, that if the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> doctrine mainetained againſt them be true, and their aſſertions be falſe, the ſeparation of the newe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19127:13"/>
Churches from ours, cannot be juſtified; yea they auouch that if this be ſo, that their ſaid Churches are ſchiſmatical. Vnto which if we adde, that in very deede the <hi>propoſitions</hi> which the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans offer</hi> to <hi>mainetaine againſt the Prelates,</hi> are falſe and erroneous (the truth of which aſſertion is confeſſed &amp; with great vehemency defended by al the <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants,</hi> and further concerning ſome of the ſaid propoſitions very vvel proued by <hi>Hooker,</hi> Whitgift, Bilſon, <hi>Couel,</hi> and others of their company) we ſhal haue our deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red concluſion, that according to the doctrine of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries the <hi>Puritans</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> our aduerſaries Churches are Schiſmatical, and that ours is the true Spouſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not here omitte by the way to aduertiſe my reader, that in the judgement of any wiſe and judicious perſon, this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment yeelded vs by our aduerſaries, cannot but alſo be a very ſtrong proofe of the truth of our <hi>Catholike</hi> cauſe. For vvhoſoeuer maturely conſidereth the matter, ſhal finde that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in rejecting the <hi>Puritan propoſitions,</hi> followe the preſcript and rule of holy Scriptures, the decrees of Councels, and the tradition of the Church and Fathers. He ſhal alſo perceiue, that the <hi>Puritans</hi> in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouching that which I haue related, build vpon very good reaſons flowing out of the very nature of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> religion, and taken from the proceedings of the vpholders of the ſame in defending it: becauſe out of the doctrine and practiſe defended by the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> againſt the <hi>Puritans,</hi> as alſo out of the proofes and reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged for themſelues, very ſtrong arguments may be drawne to confirme the truth of our whole <hi>Catholike</hi> religion, as wil ſometimes appeare in my treatiſe following. And to giue here one inſtance, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> for the authority of Arch-biſhops bring diuers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and among others this one, that peace and vnity can other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hardly be maintained in the Church.

            <p>Nowe to proſecute mine intended diſcourſe vvhich is to proue ſome errours in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſectaries, here occurreth another argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment like vnto the former, not vnfit for my purpoſe. For like as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19127:14"/>

               </note> for thus I argue. <hi>Cartwright</hi> a principal <hi>Puritan,</hi> eſteemed by thoſe of his owne ſect (as the aforeſaid author noteth) one of the only worthies of the world, telleth vs that the <hi>Popes</hi> authority is more neceſſary ouer al Churches, then the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of an Arch-biſhop ouer a prouince: but the authority of an Arch-biſhop as al our <hi>Proteſtants</hi> defend, is neceſſary ouer a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince; therefore the <hi>Popes</hi> authority is neceſſary ouer al Churches.</p>
            <p>It may be objected, that theſe arguments are taken from perſons of ſundry ſectes, of which the one confeſſeth the other to erre.

B. of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> who in his <hi>ſermon</hi> not long ſince <hi>preached before the Kinges Majeſty,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>printed by his Majeſties expreſſe commandement</hi> as the ſame Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop<note n="b" place="margin">In the epiſt. to the King pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted before the ſermon.</note> auoucheth, affirmeth and proueth out of holy Scripture firſt, that <hi>the Apoſtles kept to themſelues ordination</hi> (or authority to giue holy orders) <hi>til they appointed Biſhops vnto whome they conueied it.</hi> Secondly, that <hi>the Church of Chriſt ſucceeding, would not admit any other but Biſhops to that buſineſſe, as not juſtifiable for the Preſbiters</hi> (I vſe his wordes) <hi>either by reaſon, example, or ſcripture.</hi> And hauing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it concerning reaſon, touching example he telleth vs; that<note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>C.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>not one is to be ſhewed through the whole ſtory Eccleſiaſtical, that any beſides a Biſhop did it; and that if ſome of the inferiour ranke preſumed to doe it, his act was reuerſed by the Church for vnlawful,</hi> which he proued by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. As for ſcripture he auoucheth there is <hi>none either of holy men, or of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> which doth giue ſuch authority to Presbiters: <hi>for al the fathers</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with one conſent doe contradict it.</hi> And among others he alleageth <hi>S. Ambroſe,</hi> affirming that <hi>it is conſonant neither with Gods nor mans lawe, that any beſides a Biſhop ſhould doe it.</hi> Of the ſcriptures he writeth thus: <hi>No ſcripture of the holy Ghoſt, either anago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically by conſequent, or directly by precept</hi> doth juſtifie it. <hi>For analogie, none but the Apoſtles did it,</hi> or <hi>might doe it (as before you heard) not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for to what Preſbiter was the authority committed as a Preſbiter,</hi> &amp;c. Thus the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> plainely contradicteth the other two <hi>Engliſh Proteſtant</hi> doctors. And hence it manifeſtly appeareth, that either the ſaid Biſhop erreth in denying this power to Prieſts, or that the ſaid Doctors are falſe in yeelding it vnto them: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it is plaine, that ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſectaries fal into error. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, ſeeing that the Biſhop conuinceth by ſuch good proofes the truth of his aſſertion, and the ſaid two Doctors confeſſe ſome of their Churches to haue no other Paſtors, but ſuch as were ordered by Prieſts or Preſbiters, it is euen as apparant, that ſuch their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are in very truth no true Church.</p>
            <p>But it is nowe high time that I end my diſcourſe touching this point, yea that I conclude this my preface. Being therefore the truth of mine accuſation that the learned ſectaries, as <hi>Luther,</hi> Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19127:15"/>
               <hi>Caluin,</hi> and others haue notoriouſly and groſly erred, is ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently demonſtrated by a fewe inſtances which I haue related a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong diuers others which I haue omitted; let me nowe demand of my chriſtian reader, what reaſon he hath to ground the euerlaſting eſtate of his ſoule, either vpon the judgment of his learned maſters, or vpon his owne? And firſt concerning his learned maſters he can not deny, but they haue al erred in ſome point or other; and doth not an errour in one thing proue a poſſibilitie of erring in others of like ſort? But haue his captaines any further vvarrant concerning one article, then touching an other? They haue not vvithout al doubt. Howe doth he then knowe that they haue not erred in al points in which they diſſent from the ancient beliefe of al Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans their predeceſſours? He vvil perhaps anſwere, that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wel they erre not touching this and that, although their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be neuer ſo erroneous touching other points. Loe nowe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth al to his owne judgement; I joine therefore here with him, and firſt I aske vvhat more ſtrong vvarrant he hath that he cannot erre, then had his learned maſters? Is he comparable to them either in wit, learning, piety, or dignity of vocation? If he be not, then he is much more ſubject to errour then they, vvho notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding haue groſly and palpably erred. I adde alſo, that he taketh vpon him ouer-much in judging of ſuch high matters, and in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring his learned Doctors when they ſay true and when they erre. Moreouer, I thinke there is no man liuing which hath not in ſome thinges or others, altered his judgement and varied from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; inſomuch as he hath deemed falſe ſome thinges vvhich once ſeemed to him true, and judged others true which once he thought falſe; vvhich if it be ſo, vvhat wiſeman in matters of ſo great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as are his faith and religion, vvil truſt his owne judgement? For vvherefore may not he erre in one point as vvel as in an other? Nowe if he doe erre in matters pertaining to faith and religion, vvhat wil be come of his ſoule euerlaſtingly if he doth not alter his courſe? But howſoeuer it be, euery follower of the newe religion for the reaſons aſſigned, hath juſt cauſe to miſtruſt the truth of his owne beliefe, or vvhich is yet leſſe, not to be ſo peremptory and obſtinate in his faith, that he vvil not vvith indifferency heare or reade any thing that maketh againſt it; which is as much as I nowe craue of my <hi>curteous Reader.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EFORE I come to intreate of the particuler groundes of Catholike religion, which are rejected by our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; I thinke it not amiſſe, briefly to diſcourſe of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine general groundes of the ſame: which although I confeſſe to be admitted by diuers newe ſectaries; yet in very deede by ſome are denied, and after ſome ſort (as I wil proue hereafter) impugned and ouerthrowne by the common doctrine of them al.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>S. Paul,</hi> praerequireth the beleefe of two thinges prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, in him that is to come to the ſeruice of almighty God: firſt, that he beleeue that there is a God: ſecondly, that he likewiſe beleeue that the ſaid God wil rewarde thoſe that ſerue him:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>He that commeth to God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>muſt beleeue that he is, and is a rewarder to them that ſeeke him.</hi> Wherefore, grounding vpon this ſentence of the Apoſtle, I place the beleefe of one God, and of his diuine prouidence, for the firſt ground of our religion. For a ſecond, I wil aſſigne that we ought to beleeue God to be a rewarder of our actions in the world to come, of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Apoſtle here principally ſpeaketh. For the declaration of which, I purpoſe to proue the ſoule of man to be immortal, and that moſt certainly according to the deſerts thereof, it ſhal either be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded euerlaſtingly in heauen, or puniſhed euerlaſtingly in hel.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>SECTION THE FIRST.</hi> That there is a God.</head>
                  <p>THE auncient Philoſophers, ledde only by the force of natural reaſon, to conuince this truth reaſoned after this ſorte: we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue (ſaid they) diuers motions of natural bodies in the world, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of the heauens; which motions of neceſſity proceede from ſome cauſe &amp; mouer, which mouer either in eſſence or vertue motiue, dependeth of ſome other mouer, or no. If he dependeth not, then he is God; If he depend of ſome other, it is likewiſe demanded of that other, whether he be independent or dependent: If the firſt, then we muſt needes acknowledge him to be God, who only in his eſſence and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue motiue is independent of al others: if the ſecond, then of him the ſame queſtion may be moued, and ſo of al others, vntil we come to ſome one that is independent, and of whome al the reſt doe depend, which we muſt of neceſſity affirme to be God.</p>
                  <p>The ſame alſo is proued by the diuers ſortes &amp; degrees of creatures, as are firſt the foure elements, fire, aire, water, and earth: ſecondly, thinges mixt imperfect, as ſnowe, raine, haile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, thinges mixt perfect, as ſtones, and diuers ſortes of mettals: Fourthly, thinges which haue life vegetatiue only, as trees, hearbes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fiftly, thinges which haue life vegetatiue, and ſenſitiue, as all ſortes of beaſtes, foules, and fiſhes: Sixtly, a thing hauing beſides life vegetatiue and ſenſitiue, alſo reaſon, as man, aboue whome we place the Angels. Wherefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this aſcent of the perfections of thinges, we ſhal neuer make an end, (which is moſt abſurd) or elſe we ſhal proceede and come to ſome one thing moſt perfect, which of neceſſity we muſt confeſſe to be God.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer the natural inclination of man, to the acknowledging and worſhipping of God proueth the ſame: for no nation vnder the Sunne hath euer beene found (although neuer ſo barbarous) which hath not acknowledged and worſhipped either the true God, or elſe ſome other thing, by it ſo eſteemed: yea euery man naturally in his diſtreſſes and miſeries, flieth vnto God, and craueth helpe and ſuccour of his diuine Majeſtie.</p>
                  <p>But ſeing that I write this treatiſe for the vnlearned ſort of people, omitting to diſcourſe at large of theſe reaſons (although moſt forcible,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19127:20"/>
yea inuincible) I wil vſe eſpecially this argument following, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man (although very ſimple) may for the moſt part apprehend and conceiue, taken from the admirable conſtitution, order, harmony, beauty, and greatneſſe of the world. And firſt let euery man lift vp his eies to the heauens, and behold thoſe incorruptible bodies: Let him conſider, not only the wonderful beauty, light, and variety, of thoſe celeſtial orbes: but alſo their ſtrange order and motions, and aboue al their conſtancy in their ſaid motions, that in ſo many thouſandes of yeares, as haue paſſed ſince their firſt being, they haue not miſſed or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo much as one minute of an houre, of their aſſigned &amp; accuſtomed time: From which it proceedeth, that Aſtronomers can ſo longe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt certainely and infallibly foretel Ecclipſes, conjunctions, and ſuch other accidents of the Planets.</p>
                  <p>Among al the ornaments of the heauens, the Sunne is the moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal. The body or orbe of this Planet by Aſtronomers, is proued to be an hundred, ſixty and ſix times greater, then the globe of the earth and water: wherefore if the compaſſe of the earth and ſea, be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to be about twenty and one thouſand ſix hundred miles, what ſhal we imagine of the greatneſſe of the Sunne? If we likewiſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a ſmal time, the Sunne is in riſing and ſetting, we ſhal alſo perceiue the motion of this Planet to be moſt ſwift; for the whole body of it although ſo huge and great, commeth wholy to our ſight, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the ſame in a very ſhort time, ſo that it muſt needes moue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers miles euery minute of an houre, although the motion of it, by vs be hardly perceiued. The Sunne is the fountaine of light, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it to the Moone and Starres: By the variety of his motions we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh times, as daies, nights, monethes, and yeares. The approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and going away of it from vs, maketh the ſpring, ſommer, autumne, and winter. The Sunne with his preſence in the ſpring, as it were reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth beaſtes and plants, which ſeemed before almoſt dead through his abſence: and yealdeth them a fit ſeaſon for generation, multiplication, and bringing forth their ſeedes. Finally, the Sunne principally draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vp vapors from the ſea and land, which cauſe raine, by which the earth is ſtrangely watered, to make it fruitful. Next vnto the Sunne, the Moone vnto our ſight ſeemeth beautiful, which giueth light vnto the nights, when the Sunne is abſent. And although ſhe be variable; yet ſhe is moſt conſtant in her inconſtancy and alterations. She hath a moſt ſtrange dominion ouer the ſea, which ſhe draweth and altereth as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19127:21"/>
it were with herſelfe: for when the moone aſcendeth, the ſea increaſeth; contrariwiſe, when ſhe deſcendeth it decreaſeth, in ſo much that ſhe cauſeth (as it is probable) the flux and reflux, or ebbing and flowing of the ſea, by which the water is preſerued from putrefaction, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary effects are wrought.</p>
                  <p>But who can explicate the variety, number, beauty, and ſtrange ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the ſtarres? Surely their number is ſo great, that the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in the Pſalmes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſa.</hi> 146. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4.</note> doth attribute it vnto God <hi>to number the multitude of the ſtarres:</hi> and I doubt not, but euery man in a cleare night, beholding the heauens, and remembring what hath already beene ſaid, wil crie out with the ſame Prophet,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſ.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 1</note> and ſay. <hi>The heauens ſhewe forth the glory of God, and the firmament declareth the workes of his handes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let vs deſcend ſomething lower, and come to the foure elements, the fire, the ayre, the water, and the earth: and firſt admire their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful conſtitution. For they are ſo tempered and placed in ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that although they be indued with contrary qualities, and there be continual combates betweene them; yet the one neuer altogither ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth or ouerthroweth the other: yea, euery one of them although it hath one quality, contrary to that which is next vnto it; yet it agreeth with it in the other, &amp; two altogither oppoſite in qualities, are not joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned togither. For example, the fire is hotte and drie: the ayre next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, is hotte and moiſt: the water next vnto the ayre is moiſt &amp; cold: and the earth next vnto the water, cold and drie. Beſides this, that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is moſt actiue, hath leaſt force to reſiſt the action of others; contrariwiſe that which hath moſt force to reſiſt, is leaſt actiue; as is apparant in the fire and the earth. I adde moreouer, that al theſe ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments haue a natural inclination to their proper places: For the earth coueteth to be vnder the water: the water to be aboue the earth, and vnder the ayre: the ayre to be aboue the water, and vnder the fire: the fire aboue all the reſt. And to this ſcituation (if they be diſplaced) they moue with greatſpeede and violence, as we ſee by daylie experience.</p>
                  <p>This notwithſtanding, to the end that food, place of aboade, increaſe, growing, and dwelling may be giuen to other creatures, the water is ſeperated from ſome part of the earth, and certaine boundes are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed vnto it, which it cannot paſſe.</p>
                  <p>The ayre ſerueth man and beaſt for breath: the lower region of it, by the reflexion of the beames of the Sunne, is preſerued from that cold conſtitution which it would otherwiſe haue, by reaſon of the water and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19127:21"/>
earth adjoyning, and ſo made a fit habitation for them to liue in: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo fit for the growing of plants, hearbes, trees, and ſuch like ſenſeleſſe creatures. The midle region by vapors drawne vp from the earth and water, is made colder, and in it the ſaid vapors, through the coldneſſe of the place, are reſolued into raine, and ſhowe, by which the earth is moſt artificially moiſtened and made fruitful. The windes which be drie exhalations, toſſe the cloudes from place to place, that al partes of the earth may receiue this benefit: they ſerue alſo for paſſing from nation to nation on the ſea; they purge the ayre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the ſea, we may wel admire the vaſteneſſe and motion thereof; the certaine limites, within which it is reſtrained; the infinite number togither with the huge and ſtrange formes of fiſhes, and their wonderful increaſe. The riuers are as it were the veines of the earth: for like as in our bodies, by the veines, bloud, and moiſture is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed to euery part: ſo is the earth moiſtened by the riuers &amp; ſpringes.</p>
                  <p>The earth it ſelfe is deuided into hils, dales, and plaine ground, that it may bring forth diuerſity of fruite for man, and al ſortes of cattel, and yeeld them fit places of aboade, according to their natures: In it are diuers pretious ſtones, and ſundry ſortes of mettals, which ſerue for the vſe of man. It is adorned with variety of flowres, trees, fruits, and hearbes, farre ſurpaſſing al humaine arte and inuention; which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually nouriſheth, and receiuing ſeede from ſuch ornaments, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fertil mother, it daylie bringeth forth with great increaſe, newe fruite; and yeeldeth both man and beaſt at al times ſufficient foode: it is alſo apt for their pleaſure and recreation.</p>
                  <p>Here I could make a long diſcourſe of the bodies, &amp; nature of bruite beaſtes and fiſhes, but I ſhould be ouerlonge; and therefore at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſhal be ſufficient to wiſh euery man to conſider: Firſt, that al ſortes of ſuch liuing creatures, finde ſufficient foode agreable to their diuers natures: then, that euery one of them hath fit members, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient meanes to come by their ſaid foode: Thirdly, that al naturally knowe their enemies, and haue conuenient meanes to auoide them: Fourthly, if they be ſicke, by the inſtinct of nature, they knowe their phiſicke: Fiftly, the ſame nature giueth them knowledge, howe to feede, and bring vp their yonge ones, which eſpecially is perceiued in birdes, who at the fitteſt ſeaſon, and in the fitteſt places breede, and moſt artificially make their neſts: I adde further, that they haue al ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient veſtures to couer their nakedneſſe, and to defend themſelues
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19127:22"/>
from the extremity of cold: Finally, the bodies of al ſuch creatures are moſt aptly formed according to their natures; as of fiſhes to ſwimme, of foules to flie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what ſhal we ſay of man, for whome al theſe thinges were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and who is the King and moſt principal of al theſe inferior crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Surely he yeeldeth vs diuers points moſt worthy of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And firſt let vs note, that although our ſoule, be a ſimple and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſubſtance: yet it hath three powers moſt noble and excellent, which by Philoſophers are called the ſoules vegetatiue, ſenſitiue, and reaſonable: to the firſt it appertaineth to nouriſh our bodies, and to make them growe to conuenient ſtature and greatneſſe: The ſecond, by the vſe of our fiue ſenſes, maketh vs vnderſtand and feele thinges corporal and particuler: By the third we vnderſtand thinges ſpiritual and vniuerſal. The firſt is common alſo to trees and hearbes: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to brute beaſtes: by the third we are like vnto Angels. I wil not ſtand to diſcourſe of our fiue ſenſes, our imagination, vnderſtanding, memory and wil, becauſe theſe thinges be ſomething difficult, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire longe treatiſes.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the body of man: conſider firſt, howe ſtrangely it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the mothers wombe, in which vnto euery member is giuen his due proportion. Conſider alſo that in it there are aboue three hundred bones, litle and great, which are ſo artificially and firmely joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, and with ſuch admirable proportion, that no artificer in the world is able to make the like. Neither are the ſinewes and veines, by which the joyntes are joyned, and nouriſhment is conueied to al parts of the body, and the equal correſpondence of the partes of one ſide of the body, to the partes of the other ſide, togither with the aptneſſe of euery member to his place, and to the end for which it was ordained, leſſe admirable. Howe wonderful ſtrange is the compoſition of euery particuler member, as of the head, eies, handes, feete, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> Verily an exact deſcription of euery ſuch part, would make this ſection bigger, then the whole treatiſe which I intend. I wil adde only a word or two, of the manner of the nouriſhing of our bodies. To make the foode which we receiue fit for our ſtomacke, we haue in our mouthes two ſortes of teeth, ſome ſharpe to deuide it, others ſomething flatte or plaine to grinde it: with the tongue we remoue it from place to place, when it is ſufficiently chawed: through the throate it is conueied into the ſtomacke, where as in a pot or caldron by the heate of the hart and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19127:22"/>
liuer it is boiled, and brought al to one kinde of ſubſtance: from thence the pureſt and beſt part thereof, by ſubtil and ſmal paſſages, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueied to the liuer; the groſſeſt part, which is not fit for nutriment, is caſt out at the fundament. The liuer hauing receiued the ſaid ſubſtance, boileth it againe and turneth it into bloud, that which is ſuperfluous it ſendeth it to other places, as to the ſpleene and gal: the reſt it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeth by the vaines throughout the whole body, which is partly turned into fleſh and bones; a part of it is ſent to the hart, which being there purified, is turned into vital ſpirits; ſome is ſent to the braine, and turned into other ſpirits, which we cal animales.</p>
                  <p>Theſe conſiderations are ſufficient to perſwade euery man, that there is one ſupreame God, of infinite power and wiſedome, who hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and moſt wiſely and ſweetely diſpoſed al thinges. Hence the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid</hi> cried out unto God in the Pſalme:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>ver.</hi> 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Howe high</hi> (or wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) <hi>O Lord, are thy workes, thou hast made al thinges in wiſdome: the earth is filled with thy poſſeſsion or riches.</hi> Surely, if we looke into the nature and condition of any one creature whatſoeuer, we ſhal not only ſee,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. <hi>3.</hi> ver. <hi>14.</hi> Galen. lib. <hi>3.</hi> de vſu partium: &amp; lib. <hi>5.</hi> Pſal. <hi>99.</hi> verſ. <hi>3.</hi>

I reply, that like as it is impoſſible, that a number of letters or charecters caſt togither, without any order of ſillables, wordes, or ſentences, ſhould make a perfect booke, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining moſt wiſe, learned, and methodical diſcourſes: ſo it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the world ſhould be ſo exquiſitely ordered, and thinges ſo ordained one to another by chance, without the wiſdome and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of almighty God: And this confutation of this fond aſſertion, was vſed longe ſince by <hi>Cicero</hi> an Ethnicke. Wherefore,<note place="margin">Cicero lib. <hi>3.</hi> de natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> like as euery man would worthely account him a foole, that ſhould ſay that a booke, containing wiſe, and orderly diſcourſes, was made by chance, by the caſting togither of diuers charecters or letters; or that a houſe, moſt curiouſly and artificially built, was made without the handy worke of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19127:23"/>
any artificer, by the accidentary concourſe of ſtones, morter, timber, and other ſuch like ſtuffe: ſo we may wel eſteeme him a foole, and voide of al reaſon and vnderſtanding, who denyeth that the world was created and ordered by almighty God. Hence the Pſalme ſaith: <hi>The foole ſaid in his hart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>there is no God.</hi> And note: it is not ſaid, he ſaid with his mouth, but in his hart; to ſignifie that this aſſertion is ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde, ridiculous, and blaſphemous, that a foole, although he thinke it true in his hart; yet may be aſhamed to vtter it with his mouth.</p>
                  <p>To the arguments already brought for the proofe of this matter, I adde, that this truth is manifeſtly deliuered vnto vs, in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; in which is contained the hiſtory of the creation of the world by God, and diuers other euident proofes, are found of the being of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Majeſty: This no <hi>Atheiſt</hi> wil or can denie. But al of them anſwere, that the Scriptures containe but fables, and are of no authority. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that it may eaſily be ſhewed, that the authority of theſe diuine bookes, ought to be great in any wiſemans judgement in the world. It is proued by diuers learned authors: firſt, by their antiquity; for no volumes in the world are ſo auncient as the bookes of <hi>Moyſes:</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently we may inferre, that <hi>Moyſes</hi> himſelfe the firſt writer, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the true hiſtory of thoſe thinges which were done before his owne dayes, by ſucceſſion and tradition from his predeceſſors; for which it maketh, that <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the Iewes, might wel haue ſeene <hi>Sem</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Noe:</hi> Of other thinges he was an eie witneſſe himſelfe. Secondly, it is proued by the verity of diuers propheſies, contained in the holy Scriptures, which were fulfilled longe after that the bookes themſelues were written; which is a manifeſt demonſtration, that ſuch thinges were foretold by God, who only knoweth and can certainely fortel thinges contingent and depending of mans free wil: of which it followeth, that ſuch propheſies and the bookes in which they are found, were written by diuine inſpiration. Thirdly, it is declared by the wonderful conſent of al theſe bookes: for although they were penned by diuers men, in diuers places, vpon diuers occaſions, and at ſundry times; yet no one of them containeth any one thinge contrary to the other:<note place="margin">Gre. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. in Iob.</note> Of which <hi>S. Gregory</hi> wel inferreth; that the writers handes were the <hi>pennes of the holy Ghost.</hi> The ſame is likewiſe demonſtrated by the teſt mony of diuers miracles, which haue beene wrought alwayes in the world, for the confirmation of the doctrine, which is taught vs in theſe bookes; by the miraculous preſeruation of them, throughout
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19127:23"/>
al ages; by the admirable conſent of the ſeauenty two Interpreters, which were appointed by <hi>Ptólomie</hi> King of <hi>Aegipt</hi> to tranſlate them, and ſundrie other reaſons, which I cannot ſtand to relate.</p>
                  <p>Neither doe the miracles and propheſies aboue ſaid, and al other ſuch like effects and actions, only confirme the authority of the holy Scriptures; but alſo euidently proue, that there is a God, who only is omnipotent, and can worke effects ſurpaſſing the power and vertue of natural and created agents. Such miracles and propheſies cannot be denied to haue beene found in the world in al ages, of which we haue any large recordes; except we wil obſtinately reject the authority and teſtimony of al men. I may joyne to this, that although God be but one in eſſence; yet he is three in perſons: for although the diuine eſſence be but one moſt pure and ſimple ſubſtance, not deuided; yet the ſelfe ſame is in three diſtinct perſons, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and the holy <hi>Ghost,</hi> who are equal and conſubſtantial one to the other, and in euery place by their eſſence, preſence, and power. This is proued by Diuines, becauſe God muſt needes vnderſtand and loue himſelfe: of his vnderſtanding the Sonne is begotten; of his wil, of which is loue, proceedeth the holy Ghoſt. And although during the lawe of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and in al former ages, this high miſtery for ſome reſpects (eſpecially for feare, leaſt that men in thoſe weake daies of the Trinity of perſons, ſhould inferre three Gods) was ſomething concealed from the vulgar ſort of people; yet it was knowne and beleeued by the learned, and is manifeſtly expreſſed in the old Teſtament it ſelfe: ſee <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. where God ſpeaketh in the plural number. <hi>Let vs make man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 18. <hi>ve.</hi> 2. where <hi>Abraham</hi> ſawe our Lord as three, and adored and ſpoke vnto one in the ſingular number: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. where the <hi>heauens</hi> are ſaid, <hi>to haue beene made firme by the worde of our Lord, and al their power by the ſpirit of his mouth.

                     <hi>SECTION THE SECOND.</hi> Almighty God hath care of worldly affaires, and ruleth al thinges by his diuine prouidence.</head>
                  <p>OTHER <hi>Atheiſts</hi> there be, who although they confeſſe that there is a God; yet they bereaue him of his diuine prouidence, and make him altogither careleſſe of worldly affaires, and conſequently attribute the ſucceſſe of al matters, to fortune and policie. Theſe alſo are eaſilie confuted by diuers arguments, conuincinge them of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and blaſphemie. And firſt thus I argue; If God hath no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence and care of worldly matters, either it is becauſe he is not able to diſcharge that office, or elſe becauſe he refuſeth and wil not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the ſame; for no other cauſe can be aſſigned: but either of theſe aſſertions ouerthroweth his diuine nature, as is manifeſt: therefore we muſt needes confeſſe that by his prouidence he gouerneth the world. That the firſt is contrary to the nature of God, it is apparant; becauſe God is preſent in euery place, his power alſo, and his wiſedome and knowledge is infinite: and conſequently, by reaſon of his preſence, he is abſent from no creature; by reaſon of his infinite power, he is able to doe al thinges, and cannot be wearied; by reaſon of his infinite wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he knoweth howe al thinges are to be done, and he cannot be ouercharged with the multitude of buſineſſes; by reaſon of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite knowledge, he knoweth the nature and neceſſities of al creatures, and whoſoeuer affirmeth the contrary denieth God to be God. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth likewiſe that he is able to vndertake this gouernement, by the diſcourſe of the firſt Section. For who wil denie, but he that created al thinges in ſuch admirable order is able alſo to gouerne, and haue prouidence ouer the ſame? Hence are theſe wordes of the Prophet Iſay.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. <hi>verſ.</hi> 28.</note> 
                     <hi>God the euerlasting Lord, who created the boundes of the earth, wil not fainte nor labour; neither is there any meane to ſearch out, or comprehend his wiſdome:</hi> thus the Prophet. The ſecond likewiſe is repugnant to the nature of God, who is infinitely good: for if it be the part of a Prince, if he obtaine or inſtitute a Kingdome or common wealth, to gouerne the ſame, and the neglect of this doth impeach his credit in euery honeſt or moral mans judgement: howe can we ſay that God, who is goodnes itſelfe, refuſeth to haue any prouidence or care ouer the world by him created? doth it not appertaine to a creator, to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19127:24"/>
preſerue and gouerne his worke? what workeman neglecteth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent workemanſhip of his handes? Hence <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> affirmeth,<note place="margin">Ambr. lib. <hi>1.</hi> offic. ca. <hi>13.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>that it were great inclemency (or cruelty) in God, not to haue care ouer thoſe thinges, which he hath made.</hi> And of this reaſon I inferre, that it is euen as abſurd and blaſphemous, to denie the prouidence of almighty God; as to denie his being: for whoſoeuer denieth the firſt, impugneth the ſecond; becauſe if the denial of this prouidence, be prejudicial either to the power or goodneſſe of God, it is manifeſt, that it is alſo preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to his nature, which muſt needes be of infinite power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>This prouidence may likewiſe be proued by the firſt creation and conſtitution of the world: for ſeing that God then, out of his infinite wiſedome and goodnes (as I haue before declared) ordained one thing to another, and prouided ſufficiently for the neceſſities of al ſortes of creatures; ſeing alſo that his nature remaineth the ſame, it may wel be inferred and ſuppoſed, that he continueth alwaies the ſame care. But like as among other creatures, he had an eſpecial regard of man, in the creation of the world: for beſides that he prouided neceſſaries for his foode and apparel, for him alſo he produced the beauty and ſweete ſmelles of flowres; the pretious ſtones, muſke, diuers ſortes of ſpices; hearbes and rootes medecinable; yron, lead, tinne, ſiluer, gold, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſortes of mettals; ſugar-canes which yeeld vs ſugar; ſilke-wormes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For man alſo he gaue the loadſtone that quality that the needle, which it toucheth turneth alwaies to the North poole: So likewiſe it is euident, that the eie of Gods prouidence doth principally behold him. Moreouer the ſodaine change and alteration of worldly eſtates, as the ſodaine ruine of moſt potent empires, kingdomes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealthes, cities, and the ouerthrowe of armies, in the opinion of men inuincible: which empires, kingdomes, common wealthes, cities, and armies, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bin miraculouſly conquered by a few, farre inferior to themſelues in ſtrength, are moſt firme arguments of the prouidence of God. So likewiſe is the ſtrange puniſhment of wicked men and tyrants, and the reward of the good not ſeldome in this world, recorded in al hiſtories; but eſpecially in the old Teſtament, which the greateſt <hi>Atheiſt</hi> in the world cannot denie to be of great authority: for there we may read, that the Iewes, as long as they ſerued God, enjoyed proſperity; and contrariewiſe, when they forſooke him, fel into aduerſity &amp; a thouſand calamities. The ſame may be confirmed by diuers propheſies both of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19127:25"/>
holy Scripture, the <hi>Sibils</hi> and others, foretelling ſuch thinges vnto men, as could not be foreſeene in natural cauſes. The like argument may be taken from miracles. For why ſhould God either foretel ſuch thinges, or worke ſuch extraordinary effects, if he had no care of worldly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Finally al nations be they neuer ſo barbarous, haue euer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the prouidence of God; which is a manifeſt proofe, that the acknowledging of this, proceedeth from the inſtinct of nature it ſelfe.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.</note> Wherefore I conclude with this ſentence of the wiſeman: <hi>Doe not giue thy mouth, that thou make thy fleſh to ſinne:</hi> That is to ſay: Be not thou blaſphemous in thy wordes, againſt the prouidence of almighty God, to the end that thou maieſt ſinne more freely, <hi>and ſay not before an Angel,</hi> who is the miniſter and executor of Gods prouidence, <hi>there is no proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: leaſt that God perhaps being angry againſt thy ſpeaches, ouerthrowe al the workes of thy handes.</hi> Hitherto <hi>Salomon</hi> in the booke of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes.</hi> And this ſhal ſuffice for the proofe of the firſt ground of true religion, to wit, that there is a God; and that this God by his diuine prouidence gouerneth the world, out of which ariſeth the firſt band, that man hath to ſerue, obey, feare, loue, and praiſe God aboue al thinges. For reaſon requireth that we yeeld him theſe duties, who is the chiefeſt good thing, and the fountaine of al goodneſſe, who is the Lord, maker, and gouernor both of vs, and al other creatures.</p>

                  <hi>Chapter 2.</hi> Of the ſecond ground of our religion, to wit: that the ſoule of man is immortal, and that it ſhal either be rewarded euerlaſtingly in heauen, or puniſhed euerlaſtingly in hel.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE immortality of the ſoule of man, which I aſſigned for the ſecond general ground of religion, may briefly be proued by theſe forcible reaſons. Firſt thus I argue: A thing ſpiritual, and independent of al corporal ſubſtance, which hath no original cauſe of decay in it ſelfe, cannot be corrupted or deſtroied by any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral agent, or any intrinſecal quality contained in it ſelfe: But the ſoule of man is ſpiritual, and independent of al corporal ſubſtance, and hath no original cauſe of decay in it ſelfe: Therefore it cannot be corrupted or deſtroied by any corporal agent; or any intrinſecal quality contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19127:25"/>
in it ſelfe. The truth of the firſt propoſition appeareth by this, that al corruption muſt of neceſſity proceede, either of ſome intrinſecal or extrinſecal cauſe. And that a thing ſpiritual, and in his being indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of al corporal ſubſtance, (eſpecially of that which by the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers is called <hi>materia prima;</hi> which is the fountaine and cauſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the foure elements, and al other thinges of them compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) and hauing in it ſelfe no intrinſecal quality, that can bring it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, cannot poſſibly periſh through any intrinſecal cauſe; it is moſt manifeſt. And what extrinſecal cauſe can deſtroy a thing ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, beſides the omnipotent power of God? The ſecond likewiſe may eaſily be proued: For firſt (beſides that the nature of the ſoule it ſelfe hath no contrary oppugning it) it is euident that the principal powers of the ſame (I meane the vnderſtanding, wil, and memory,) depend not in their operations, of any certaine corporal organ or part of the body, as our corporal ſenſes doe: of which it followeth that they may be ſeperated from the ſaid body, &amp; retaine notwithſtanding after ſuch ſeperation, their operations; and conſequently that they be ſpiritual: which prerogatiue if it be granted to the powers of the ſoule, it cannot be denied to the ſoule it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, although the vnderſtanding in diuers firſt operations, craueth aide of the ſenſes, and the ſenſual imagination; yet it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that his principal operations are independent of them. For the vnderſtanding diſcourſeth of it ſelfe; reflecteth vpon his owne opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and knoweth it ſelfe to knowe; apprehendeth thinges vniuerſal; inferreth one thing of an other; by thinges ſenſible and corporal, it cometh to the knowledge of thinges ſpiritual, yea of God himſelfe; contemplateth vertue, and judgeth that for the loue of it, corporal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries are patiently to be ſuffered; correcteth the errors of the ſenſes; knoweth vice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Al which operations are ſpiritual independent of the body, and aboue the object of our corporal ſenſes. And ſeing that the ſoule hath ſuch operations, it neceſſarily requireth a manner of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, anſwerable vnto them; that it may not only remaine perfect, and incorruptible, after the corruption of the body, and the ſeperation of it ſelfe from the ſame: but alſo then exerciſe ſuch operations. The ſoule likewiſe coueteth eternity, loueth vertue, and hateth vice, and is ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with freewil; which be manifeſt proofes of a ſpiritual and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Further, God hath ordained euery creature to ſome end; Neither is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19127:26"/>
any one to be tearmed perfectlie happy and contented, vntil it attaine to the ſaid end, and in it as fully ſatiated, reſteth. And ſeing that the end and perfect felicity of man, cannot be obtained in this life. For no worldlie thing, which man in this life can comprehend or poſſeſſe, is able to ſatisfie his vnderſtanding and wil: wherefore, ſeing alſo that euery thing is ſo created, that at ſome time or other it may enjoy his end and felicity, the final and chiefeſt happineſſe of man, muſt needes conſiſt in ſome thing, which he may attaine vnto after his death, and in the world to come; and conſequently his ſoule is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. Some Epicure perhaps wil contend, that the final end and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame happineſſe of man, doth conſiſt in the enjoying of worldly pleaſures: but this cannot be; both becauſe theſe neuer ſatiate man. For the ſoule is neuer fully contented with the worldly pleaſures, with which ſhe is delighted; yea (not ſeldome) in a ſmal time loatheth that which before ſhe moſt deſired: and alſo, becauſe if this were true, and the ſoule were mortal, we muſt needes condemne God of injuſtice, who not ſeldome ſuffereth the wicked to liue in ſuch pleaſures, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaueth the juſt of the ſame; and moreouer ſuffereth them to fal into a thouſand miſeries and calamities, which he could not in juſtice doe, if the true felicity of man did conſiſt in the enjoying of worldlie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
               <p>The ſame may be confirmed by the conſent of moſt of the auncient Philoſophers, and generally of al nations; which doth manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that natural reaſon it ſelfe is ſufficient to perſwade any man this truth. I adde further, that if any credit be to be giuen to holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or authentical hiſtories, diuers ſoules of men dead, haue appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto men liuing. Finally, this appertained to the manifeſtation, both of the omnipotencie of the power of God, and alſo to the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the world, and variety of creatures; that like as God created ſome creatures altogither ſpiritual, as are the Angels: and others alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither corporal, as are al earthly creatures beſides man: ſo he ſhould create one creature partlie ſpiritual and partlie corporal, in which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree we place only man. And hence it proceedeth that in the booke of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> in the hiſtory of the creation of the world we read, that al other liuing corporal creatures, being produced and framed of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral ſubſtance; as fiſh and foule of the water, and beaſtes of the earth;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>God inſpired</hi> or breathed <hi>into the face of man the breath of life:</hi> by which is ſignified, that the ſoule of man only, among al ſuch creatures,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19127:26"/>
was created by God, and not produced of any earthly ſubſtance; and conſequently, that it only is immortal. And this is alſo ſignified vnto vs by thoſe wordes of God:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 26.27.</note> 
                  <hi>Let vs make man according to our Image and likenes.</hi> For he is like vnto God: Firſt, becauſe his vnderſtanding is apt to conceiue al thinges, and therefore may in ſome ſort, be ſaid to be of an infinite capacitie: ſecondly, becauſe his wil cannot be fully ſatiated with any thing, but almightie God, who is an infinite good thing, and therefore alſo is after a ſort infinite: thirdly, becauſe the wil hath free liberty, and is not bound to this or that: laſtly, becauſe the ſoule hath a certaine natural inclination and deſire to immortality. Al which inclinations and properties of the vnderſtanding and wil, proue the ſoule it ſelfe to be immortal.</p>
               <p>For the proof of the other part of the title of this Chapter: <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſoule of man moſt certainely ſhal be either rewarded in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or puniſhed in hel, after this life euerlaſtingly; I muſt preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe two thinges, as true. Firſt, that among the actions of man ſome be vertuous, others vitious. This is taught vs by the lawe of nature it ſelfe; from whence it proceedeth, that al nations haue euer eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med blaſphemie, perjurie, murther, theft, adulterie, and ſuch like actions, vicious; and contrariewiſe, they haue judged juſtice, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, fortitude, and other ſuch like laudable diſpoſitions, to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I muſt preſuppoſe that man hath free wil: which I am not in this place to prooue out of holy Scripture againſt Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes: but to ſhewe by natural reaſon againſt <hi>Atheistes.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I prooue it firſt, becauſe al nations by the inſtinct of nature, haue euer puniſhed vice, which they could not haue done, had not man free wil to auoide it. For no man can juſtlie be puniſhed for a fault, which he cannot chooſe but commit. Hence alſo proceed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of eſtate in al kingdomes and common wealthes, and conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and deliberations concerning peace, warre, and other matters; what courſe is to be taken; howe this and that may be compoſed; howe imminent dangers may be auoided <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were al in vaine, if it were not in mans power to doe this; or that. Finally, euery one findeth it true in himſelfe by experience, that it is in his owne power to doe or leaue vndone, any action that he vndertaketh, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth inforce him to doe that, which he doth, but that he doth it of his owne free choiſe and election.</p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:19127:27"/>Out of theſe two aſſertions preſuppoſed I inferre, that Gods juſtice hath ordained a heauen and a hel after this life. For it was neceſſary that man both by promiſe of reward, ſhould be allured to vertue, and that by the feare of hel he ſhould be withdrawne from vice: and alſo that they, which out of their owne free wil with the helpe of Gods grace, embraced vertue, ſhould haue ſome reward for the ſame: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariewiſe that they which followed vice, ſhould receiue their juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. And ſeing that this retribution is ſeldome ſeene to be made in this world (for the juſt and vertuous are diuers times afflicted euen to death; and the wicked contrariewiſe euen to their end enjoy proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.) It is certaine that theſe thinges are reſerued for the world to come. Further, becauſe the ſoule is then ſeperated from the world and the fleſh, and conſequently freed from al combates betweene vice and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, we may wel inferre, that the ſoule ſhal remaine for euer in ſuch ſtate, as it is found at the houre of death. And this might alſo be proued by holy Scriptures, of whoſe authority euen againſt <hi>Atheiſts</hi> before: by diuers apparitions recorded in authentical Authors, which no man can in wiſdome and reaſon reject as falſe and forged: and the conſent of al nations. Out of this diſcourſe I gather an other motiue or band, that man hath to ſerue God and liue vertuouſly. For ſeing that his ſoule is to remaine for euer, either in perpetual joy in heauen, or in perpetual paine in hel, according to his deſerts, it behoueth euery one with al his endeauour to embrace vertue, and eſchewe vice; becauſe eternal joy, is to be preferred before any tranſitory pleaſure, and any temporal paine whatſoeuer is to be indured, rather then the euerlaſting.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE already proued that there is a God, who by his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent power hath created al thinges, and by his diuine wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and prouidence gouerneth the ſame. I haue alſo decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the ſoule of man is immortal, and to be rewarded or puniſhed euerlaſtingly in heauen or hel, according to his merits or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19127:27"/>
during this temporal life. Out of which moſt true aſſertions, I haue gathered, that man oweth God al dutie, both in reſpect of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of his diuine Majeſtie, and alſo for the benefits receiued at his moſt bountiful handes. I haue likewiſe inferred of this, that the eternal eſtate of our ſoule, dependeth of the wel or euil ſpending of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this tranſitory life: that we ought to haue a ſpecial care to liue wel and vertuouſly.</p>
               <p>Nowe, becauſe the ground of all dutie vnto God, and the fountaine of al true vertue, is true religion, which is defined by Diuines to be a vertue, by which man doth giue to God worſhip and reuerence: Let vs goe on and ſhewe, where this ſupreame vertue is to be found, and what ſort of people can lay juſt claime to ſo noble and pretious a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And ſeing that man is not only taught and bound by the lawe of nature it ſelfe, to be religious, (from whence it proceedeth that al nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnder the heauens, haue alwaies adored ſome God, true or falſe:) but alſo cannot poſſible without this vertue, attaine to the final end (I meane the euerlaſting ſaluation of his ſoule) I may wel affirme that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is both a vertue principally to be regarded by mortal men, and that the exerciſe thereof, is (as it were) the end wherefore a certaine time is alotted them to liue in this pilgrimage; and alſo that God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty (ſuppoſing that he wil be dulie honored, and ſerued by them in this world, and giue euery man ſufficient meanes to attaine to his chiefeſt happineſſe in heauen) cannot ſuffer at any time true religion, cleane to periſh or altogither to decay on earth. For if this may be, or could euer haue beene, God may be, or could haue beene altogither depriued of his due honour from men: and men likewiſe voide of al meanes of obtaining their final end. True it is, that man by original ſinne, committed by his firſt parents in Paradiſe, ſtraied from this final end, and deſerued euerlaſting damnation; but the goodneſſe and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his maker through the merits of our Sauiour IESVS Chriſt, and by faith in him, reſtored him againe although not altogither to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer felicity, yet to poſſibility of ſaluation; and conſequently through his grace gaue him power to ſerue God in this world, and to enjoy him through al eternity in the next. Of which it followeth, that being ſo that God hath alwaies required honour and ſeruice from man, and left him ſufficient meanes to attaine to eternal bliſſe, that he hath alwaies in like manner in ſome place or other, beene dulie ſerued; and in ſome place or other hath preſerued true religion.</p>

This is manifeſt, becauſe God (as I haue ſhewed) hath euer beene religiouſly worſhipped by ſome people or other; but no other people can be named, that can make any juſt challenge to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, during ſome ages before Chriſt, beſides the Iewes: it followeth therefore that the Iewes had true religion, which may likewiſe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the teſtimony of holy Scripture, of whoſe authority before; by diuers miracles in them recorded, and ſundry propheſies in them contained, nowe verified; and other arguments. And hence I bring my firſt reaſon for the proofe of the truth of Chriſtian religion, which I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme to be the true worſhip of God. For if it be granted that true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was in thoſe daies among the Iewes, it muſt needes alſo be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that it is now among the Chriſtians.

And ſeing that commonly they fel vpon al the perſecutors of Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and commonly vpon no others, it is euident that their perſecution of the Church of Chriſt, was the cauſe of their ſaid miſeries and calamities. I could adde diuers other reaſons, conuincing Chriſtian religion to be the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; as that moſt wiſe men, and moſt profound and deepe Schollers, moſt expert in al ſciences, and moſt perfect in thoſe languages, which ſeeme moſt needful to attaine to the knowledge of true religion, haue approued and embraced Chriſtian doctrine.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the chapter next before, I haue declared that the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe of God, and true religion, is only to be found among Chriſtians: nowe I goe further, and affirme that al Chriſtians cannot truly challenge to themſelues theſe ineſtimable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; but that they are due only to vs Catholikes. Before this I haue diſputed againſt <hi>Atheiſtes, Infidels, Iewes,</hi> and other external enemies of Chriſt, and therefore I vſed not any arguments taken out of the newe Teſtament, which they with one conſent reject: nowe I am to deale with Heretikes, who pretend themſelues to be Chriſtians, but haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of Chriſts fold, yet admit of the authority of ſundry bookes, not only of the old, but alſo of the newe Teſtament; and therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe, I wil alleage as occaſion ſhall ſerue diuers ſentences out of the ſaid bookes by them admitted. And to proceede orderly in this matter, I wil bring my whole diſcourſe to certaine principal concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of which although ſome be partly already proued againſt external Infidels; yet I wil briefly proue them againe out of the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, againſt Heretikes.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, that Chriſt is the redeemer of al mankinde, and that by his bitter paſſion and paineful death, he hath ſatisfied for al our ſins, if we pleaſe to apply his merits to our ſoules,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Io.</hi> 2, 2. 1. <hi>Io.</hi> 1, 7. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2, 13. <hi>Col.</hi> 1, 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9, 11.</note> euery Chriſtian muſt needes confeſſe: for this is moſt plainely affirmed in the holy Scripture, in which it is ſaid, that Chriſt <hi>is the propitiation for the ſinnes of the whole world:</hi> that his <hi>bloud doth cleanſe vs from al ſinnes:</hi> and that <hi>we are bought and redeemed with his pretious bloud.</hi> It muſt likewiſe be granted by al Chriſtians, that Chriſt by his infinite merits purchaſed to himſelfe a Church on earth: that is to ſay, eſtabliſhed a newe religion, and a newe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19127:31"/>
law among men; ordained Apoſtles, Paſtors, Gouernours of his flocke; inſtituted newe Sacraments, by which his faithful people through his merits were to receiue forgiuenes of ſinnes, and his grace in this world, and euerlaſting glory if they deſerued it, in the next. This likewiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in as plaine wordes is deliuered vnto vs in the ſaid word of God: in which we read, that <hi>Christ purchaſed his Church with his bloud;</hi>

                  <hi>that he loued her, and deliuered himſelfe</hi> to death <hi>for her to ſanctifie her, cleanſing her with the lauer of water in the word</hi> of life, <hi>that he might preſent to himſelfe a glorious Church not hauing ſpot or wrinckle.</hi> And al this is alſo manifeſt by reaſon: for what other cauſe can be aſſigned, of the incarnation &amp; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, but the redemption of man, &amp; the erecting of a Church and religion, which may guide him to euerlaſting ſaluation?</p>
               <p>Out of theſe two aſſertions I gather a third, to wit: that there is but one true Chruch of Chriſt, in which true religion is only to be found among Chriſtians; and conſequently that they only, who are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Church, truly worſhip God, and are in ſtate of grace in this world, and in the right way to eternal bliſſe in the next. And firſt, that Chriſt hath but one true Church on earth, it is euident; becauſe he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his owne aſſertion, <hi>is the way,</hi> and <hi>the veritie,</hi> and <hi>the life.</hi>

                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6.</note> Wherefore like as there is but one <hi>life</hi> Chriſt, who by his bitter paſſion redeemed al mankind from euerlaſting death, and giueth man true life in heauen: ſo this one <hi>life</hi> ordained one only <hi>way</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> whereby to attaine to the ſaid <hi>life</hi> and ſaluation, erecting one only Church, vnto which the fruit &amp; merit of his paſſion ſhould be deriued. Like as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, God made firſt but one man <hi>Adam</hi> and one woman <hi>Eue,</hi> who were the corporal or carnal father and mother of the tranſitory life of al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: ſo he hath conſtituted but one ſpiritual father Chriſt, and one ſpiritual mother, which is his only Spouſe the Church, who are the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual parents of the ſpiritual life of his true children. Moreouer, like as God hath giuen one only corporal body, although adorned with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of members, to one head to be gouerned: ſo he hath framed one only miſtical body, for one miſtical head which is Chriſt, which he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſupreame head directeth and gouerneth.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2.</note> Hence we are told by <hi>Salomon</hi> in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> that the <hi>Doue</hi> of Chriſt <hi>is one perfect, and choſen to her mother.</hi> The Apoſtle likewiſe telleth vs, that there is <hi>one Lord, one Faith,</hi> and <hi>one Baptiſme;</hi> and conſequently one Church. Finally, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer affirmeth that Chriſt hath erected more Churches then one, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth al ſenſe and reaſon, ſeing that vnitie is to be preferred before
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19127:32"/>
diuiſion and diſcord; and no cauſe can be aſſigned, why two Churches ſhould be founded. Of this it alſo followeth, that out of the one Church of Chriſt there is no ſaluation. For if our bleſſed Sauiour by his death eſtabliſhed one only Church, it is euident that they only are partakers of his holy merits, who are members of that Church, and that they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are in the true way to ſaluation, who imbrace that doctrine and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is taught and preſcribed in the ſaid Church. Hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth that famous ſentence of <hi>S. Ciprian,</hi>

                  <hi>If any man could eſcape that was without the</hi> arke <hi>of</hi> Noe: <hi>he alſo may eſcape that is out of the Church.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations induce al thoſe that profeſſe themſelues Chriſtians, of what religion or ſect ſoeuer they be, to challenge to themſelues the true Church of Chriſt. This challenge is made by them, that profeſſe the <hi>Roman</hi> faith; it is made by the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> it is made by the <hi>Zwinglians;</hi> it is made by the <hi>Engliſh Protestantes,</hi> by the <hi>Caluinists</hi> or <hi>Puritans,</hi> by the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> by the <hi>Libertines;</hi> it is made finally by al newe <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and hath euer beene made by al <hi>Heretikes,</hi> ſince the beginning of Chriſtian religion. And although the multitude of challengers, with

their falſe and painted reaſons, make ſome doubtful who of al theſe haue right and a juſt title, to the thing challenged: yet certaine it is, and moſt eaſilie to be proued, that the firſt challengers only (who through the whole vvorld are tearmed <hi>Catholikes</hi>) haue juſtice and right on their ſide.</p>
               <p>The proofe of this would aſke a long diſcourſe, of the definition and notes of the Church; but in this preſent treatiſe, I purpoſe only to declare, that we <hi>Catholikes</hi> only haue true faith, and build our ſaid faith and religion vpon moſt ſure and firme groundes: Contrariewiſe that al ſectaries are bereaued of this ſupernatural gift, and build their whole beleefe and religion vpon their owne fancies.

               <p>One reaſon which moued me to take this courſe is, that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal controuerſie betweene vs and our aduerſaries, is concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith; which is manifeſt, becauſe we condemne them of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which proceedeth of miſ-beleefe in faith: for he that erreth not in faith may be a <hi>Schiſmatike,</hi> but he cannot be an <hi>Heretike;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I proue that we <hi>Catholikes</hi> haue true faith, and that our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries haue no faith, the controuerſie betweene vs and them, is after ſome ſort decided. An other reaſon is, becauſe faith doth eſpecially incorporate vs in the Church, and make vs members of the ſame: It is the lincke and glewe, yea the ſinnewe which vniteth and bindeth vs to this body: It is the roote and foundation of al true religion and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.<note n="a" place="margin">

Hence <hi>S. Athanaſius</hi> that great piller of Chriſtes Church beginneth his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19127:33"/>
Creede, which is receiued by the whole Church, with this notable and famous ſentence. <hi>Whoſoeuer wil be ſaued before al thinges, it is neceſſary that he hold the</hi> Catholike <hi>faith, which except euery man ſhal keepe wholy and not corrupted, without doubt he ſhal periſh euerlastingly.</hi> This is the cenſure of that holy Father. The reaſon of this is, becauſe we cannot attaine to a certaine knowledge of the firſt groundes and principles of Chriſtian religion (they being ſupernatural) by the force of our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and weake vnderſtanding; wherefore a ſupernatural knowledge of them being requiſite, it is neceſſary that this be done by ſupernatural faith, which giueth vs power, and lifting vp our vnderſtanding, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs able to beleeue them, becauſe they are reuealed by God; and of this neceſſity &amp; excellency of faith it followeth, that without it there can be no true Church or religion: for how can the true Church or true religion be, without the ground and foundation of al true vertue and Chriſtianity? Contrariwiſe, where true faith is found, there is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ground of true religion; of which I inferre, that if I proue the new ſectaries to haue no faith, I likewiſe proue them to haue no church nor religion: but on the other ſide, if I proue our faith to be true, I proue alſo that the ground of al religion is among vs, and conſequently, that if we build hope and charity vpon this foundation, we are members of the true Church, trulie religious, and in the ſure way to euerlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Let vs therefore briefly behold both our groundes and theirs, and according to the ſtrength or weakeneſſe of them, decide the whole controuerſie betweene vs. But to proceede the more plainely and diſtinctly, I wil firſt adde a word or two, of the nature and conditions of true faith.</p>

                  <p>THE Diuines moſt trulie affirme, that the object or ſubject of our ſupernatural faith, is God as God; becauſe al thinges which by it are knowne and beleeued, tend to this, that by ſupernatural and reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led groundes, we attaine to as ful a knowledge of him, as can by vs be had in this life. Wherefore I may wel ſay, that by faith we beleeue mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries aboue our reaſon, although none co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to our reaſon: for faith only leadeth reaſon further then of it ſelfe it can reach, and maketh it ſtoope, and ſubmit it ſelfe to the moſt certaine reuelation of God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that he doth manifeſt vnto it miſteries, which in ſome ſort ſeeme to reſiſt our ſenſe and reaſon.

God likewiſe would haue it ſo, not only to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt vnto vs his owne Majeſtie, and that he wil be beleeued at his word: but alſo for mans greater humiliation and merit.</p>
                  <p>But although the object of faith ſo farre ſurpaſſe our reaſon, and by this meanes cauſe obſcurity in our vnderſtanding; yet certaine it is, that God (if he would) might haue ſo declared and apparantly proued the miſteries of our faith, that the truth of them might haue bin farre more manifeſt then it is: yea he might haue made it ſo apparant, that no man of ſenſe could haue denied them. As for example: Chriſt might (if it had pleaſed him) haue appeared after his reſurrection to the whole Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> yea to the whole world; and by force of miracles, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, and other ſuch like motiues, haue preſently made Chriſtian faith ſeeme euidently true, to euery mans eie. So likewiſe at this preſent it is in his power, to doe for the manifeſtation of the truth of <hi>Catholike</hi> religion; wherefore then did he not in old time, and doth he not nowe proceed after this manner? wherefore leaueth he the object of faith (in this ſenſe alſo) inuironed with ſome obſcurity? I anſwere, that moſt certaine it is, that euery man hath or may haue if he pleaſe, ſufficient motiues and reaſons, to perſwade him to imbrace the true religion, and beleeue the whole ſumme of chriſtian doctrine. For God requireth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at our handes (as the Apoſtle tearmeth it) <hi>a reaſonable obſequie</hi> or obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Neuertheleſſe he hath not vſed,<note place="margin">

For the more reaſon and proof that the wil hath to perſwade her, the leſſe thankes ſhe deſerueth for obeying; and ſo much the leſſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19127:35"/>
reward ſhal be reaped by man in heauen, by howe much the ſtronger arguments he hath to moue his vnderſtanding to beleeue; becauſe one only argument infalliblie prouing any article to be reuealed by God, is ſufficient to make it the object of faith, although the matter ſeeme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo obſcure; yea, although it ſeeme (in ſome ſort) repugnant to the ordinary courſe and nature of ſenſible creatures: and thus much of the ſecond point.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19127:36"/>
becauſe this is eaſilie gathered out of that which hath beene already ſaid: for if faith be a moſt firme and certaine aſſent of the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thinges aboue the reach of reaſon, and the object of it be the miſteries of our beleefe; it muſt needes follow, that the authority of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God (whoſe knowledge and wiſdome are infinite, and whoſe ſayinges are of infallible truth) muſt cauſe vs to beleeue the ſaid miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. If any wil denie this, I wil demand of him, howe we can poſſibly attaine to a certaine knowledge of ſo high miſteries, but by the reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God? and this is that which al Chriſtians commonly profeſſe, when as being demanded why they beleeue this and that; they anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were, becauſe God hath reuealed ſuch doctrine.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe, that men are commonly firſt induced to faith by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine reaſons, which the Diuines cal arguments of credibility: ſuch are miracles, vvhich proceeding from God, can giue no teſtimony to falſhood; the authority, wiſedome, learning, and conſent of the profeſſors of our religion in al ages ſince it beganne; the ſtrange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the propagation of our ſaid religion being ſo ſtrict, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the vvhole vvorld by a fewe fiſher-men; the miraculous preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Church, oppugned by ſo diuers and mighty enemies; the conſtancy of our Martirs; the great change to the better, vvhich our religion cauſeth in thoſe that embrace it; the purity of doctrine and ſanctity of life ſhining in the Prelates and Children of our Church; the conformity of our faith vvith natural reaſon, in not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it, although aboue it, and other motiues, which I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the third Chapter of this treatiſe, which make the object of faith (in the judgement of any prudent man) credible, and of which, either one, ſome, or al, induce men firſt to beleeue. But al theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are only inducements to the true act of ſupernatural faith, by vvhich the miſteries of our beleefe are afterwardes beleeued; not for any ſuch reaſons, but only becauſe they are reuealed by God. This moued Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> to deſcribe faith after this ſort:<note place="margin">Baſilius in ſer. de fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſs. ſiue de ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra &amp; pia fide in Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceticis.</note> 
                     <hi>Faith</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is an aſſenting approbation of thoſe thinges, which through the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of God haue beene preached:</hi> thus Saint <hi>Baſil.</hi> Hence I inferre, that although faith and alſo other arguments, haue the ſame effect in our vnderſtanding; vvhich is, to make it giue a firme aſſent to ſome veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is done by ſundry arguments, eſpecially by ſuch as are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led demonſtrations: yet, there is this difference betweene ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and faith, that they doe this through euidence of the matter:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19127:37"/>
faith doth it through the authority of the reuealer, leauing ſtil the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obſcure. And this doctrine is conſonant to that of Diuines, who hold the firſt and ſupreame verity of God, to be the formal object of our faith: the ſence of which their aſſertion is, that the chiefe reaſon or cauſe, on which (as on a foundation) the habit of our faith relieth and reſteth, and into which, both it and the aſſent of it proceeding, is laſtly reſolued, is the diuine and infallible reuelation of God, or (which is al one) God infallibly reuealing ſome truth by ſome Canonical writer, or other lawful definer of faith; of which it followeth, that faith of his owne nature doth aſſent to no propoſition, which is not propounded by diuine reuelation.</p>

                  <p>IN the precedent ſections of this Chapter I haue declared, that faith is a moſt firme aſſent of the vnderſtanding, to ſuch miſteries as God hath reuealed to al Chriſtians to be beleeued. Nowe I muſt further lay this moſt certaine and vndoubted ground to this, that (according to the ordinary proceedings of God, beſides the reuelation by him heretofore made of the miſteries of Chriſtian beleefe) by the habit of faith we giue aſſent to the articles reuealed: it is alſo neceſſary, that the ſaid articles be propounded vnto vs by ſome infallible authority, aſſuring vs that they are ſo deliuered. This reaſon it ſelfe teacheth vs: for ſeing that Chriſt hath with-drawne his viſible preſence from vs, and he himſelfe immediately after a ſenſible manner inſtructeth no man, but al by ſome common rule or meanes: ſeing alſo that the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſuch miſteries is obſcure, and no man by the ſtrength and force of natural reaſon can aſſure himſelfe, that ſuch and ſuch articles haue beene reuealed; it was neceſſary that God ſhould ordaine ſome infallible authority to be the Miſtris of faith, which might infallibly teach the truth in al ſuch matters doubtful: neither had he otherwiſe ſufficiently prouided vs meanes neceſſary for our euerlaſting ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I adde alſo, that although it were ſo that we were certaine at the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19127:37"/>
beginning of our beleefe, of ſuch a reuelation: yet, that the weakeneſſe &amp; inconſtancy of our vnderſtanding is ſuch, that without a ſure guide and directour, it eaſily erreth and ſtraieth from the truth receiued. This notwithſtanding, we make not this propoſition or propounding of ſuch verities as are reuealed by God, any eſſential part of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal object of faith; of which I haue ſpoken before; for we affirme ſuch miſteries in themſelues, before any ſuch propoſition, to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible and worthy of beleefe: but becauſe this is vnknowne to vs, we require ſuch a propoſition only as a neceſſary condition to this, that we infallibly knowe that they are ſo reuealed; which muſt of neceſſity be knowne, before that we can actually aſſent vnto them by ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faith.</p>
                  <p>What infallible authority then haue we (without al feare and doubt of falſhood) aſſuring vs that al the articles of our faith haue beene thus reuealed by God? Verily no other, but the Spouſe of Chriſt our Mother the Church, vvhome our Lord hath made our Miſtris and guide in ſuch matters.</p>
                  <p>And trulie, that we are to learne our beleefe of the Prelates and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church, we are aboundantly taught by the ſacred word of God.

And that theſe preachers are the Prelates and Paſtors of the Church, it is manifeſt; becauſe they are the true ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of the Apoſtles, who in the beginning of Chriſtianity, from Chriſt receiued authority &amp; commandement,<note place="margin">

It alſo condemneth hereſies and preſcribeth general preceptes of manners touching good and il: wherefore the ancient <hi>Catholike</hi> buildeth vpon her authority, not only his faith touching the point mentioned; but alſo (in ſome ſort) his whole beleefe, and conſequently al his internal vertues grounded vpon the ſame. He relieth likewiſe on her doctrine for his externall carriage, concerning vertue and vice; and finally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth al her faith as infallibly reuealed by God himſelfe, who hath made her ſupreame judge of al controuerſies touching matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and aſſured vs that her judgement is not only certaine and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but alſo (through the perpetual aſſiſtance and direction of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt) diuine: ſo that God directeth her in al truth, and by her as a ſenſible guide, he beſtoweth the ſame benefit vpon vs in al thinges ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſaluation: wherefore our whole beleefe and religion in ſuch ſort dependeth of her infallible authority, that if this be proued, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth that to be true, ſincere, and diuine.</p>
                  <p>For no man can denie, but in building vpon the tradition, deciſion, or definition of the Church, we ground our faith and religion vpon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine authority, if her decrees be Gods, and her doctrine warranted to be his.

                     <hi>SECTION THE THIRD.</hi> The Church cannot ſtray from the rule of faith receaued, nor erre in matters of faith or general precepts of manners, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued first, becauſe the holy Ghoſt directeth her in al truth.</head>
                  <p>THIS being proued I muſt nowe declare, that the Church hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer erred, nor can erre from this rule of faith receiued, and that her judgement concerning matters of religion, is of diuine and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble authority. The moſt principal reaſon vſually brought for the proofe of this, is: that God himſelfe (to wit, the holy Ghoſt the third perſon of the moſt bleſſed Trinity, who is ſubject to no errour or falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) is the guide and director of the Church in al ſuch affaires. And this we are taught by Chriſt, who likewiſe being God the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the moſt bleſſed Trinity, cannot deceaue vs. For this promiſe he made to his Apoſtles immediately after his laſt ſupper, theſe vvere his wordes:<note place="margin">

Surely if this promiſe vvas not brought to effect, the breach of it either proceeded of vvant of power, or of vvant of vvil in Chriſt: but vvhat Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian can imagine, that either of theſe was wanting in the Sonne of God? Hence I gather, that although our Sauiour (during the time of his being on earth) both before and after his paſſion, gaue to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles diuers inſtructions touching Chriſtian religion; yet, that he left the ful and perfect inſtruction of them to the holie Ghoſt, vvho vvas to reduce al thinges to memorie, and to eſtabliſh them perfectly in faith; and whome his Father was to ſend by his mediation, to be the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19127:40"/>
cheefeſt inſtructor and guide of his Church in al truth, to the vvorldes end. And this vvas done on the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> vvhen the holie Ghoſt in the likeneſſe of <hi>firie tongues,</hi>

Wherefore, like as Chriſt is tearmed the <hi>head</hi> and <hi>huſband</hi> of the Church (as I vvil euen nowe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare) ſo the holie Ghoſt is aptly tearmed by <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine, <hi>her ſoule.</hi>

Some man perhaps vvil anſwere, that Chriſt made this promiſe of the aſſiſtance of the holie Ghoſt to the Apoſtles only, and not to their ſucceſſors: but this aſſertion is moſt abſurd, and contrary to the vvordes themſelues of holie Scripture. For Chriſt (as I haue noted before) erected not a Church for the daies of the Apoſtles only: but to continue vntil the end of the vvorld, as vvas foretold by the Prophets, that men in al ages to come might haue a meane to attaine to ſaluation; vvherefore thoſe thinges vvhich he ſpoke to his Apoſtles and Diſciples, he ſpoke alſo to al their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.<note place="margin">

Finally, the vvordes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of Chriſt aboue cited, are plaine: for howe can the holie Ghoſt remaine here on earth, vvith thoſe Apoſtles vnto vvhome Chriſt ſpake, <hi>for euer;</hi> ſeing that they liued in the vvorld but for a ſhort time? Wherefore he remaineth vvith their ſucceſſors, the Biſhoppes and Prelates of the Church, vvho haue ſucceeded the firſt Apoſtles, as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19127:41"/>
children their parents; and with theſe he ſhal remaine as long as the world ſhal endure.</p>
                  <p>For the confirmation of this truth I adde, that this aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt in the Church, was long ſince foretold by the Prophet <hi>Iſaie.</hi> Theſe wordes he vſeth, ſpeaking in the perſon of God, of the ſtate of the Church in the lawe of grace.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>but that it ſhal alwaies be gouerned by the holy Ghoſt, and ſupported with heauenly doctrine.</hi> And ſoone after: <hi>The promiſe is ſuch, that the Lord wil ſo aſsist the Church, and haue ſuch care of her, that he wil neuer ſuffer her to be depriued of true doctrine:</hi> Thus farre <hi>Caluin.</hi> Finally, <hi>Beza</hi> his Scholler confeſſeth,<note place="margin">Beza de haereticis a ciuili Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu punien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis. pa. <hi>69.</hi> Ire. li. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi> li. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>

                  <p>Moreouer, our Sauiour made his Church the ſupreame judge on earth, of al controuerſies touching matters of religion: for it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that from her judgement he graunteth no appeale; and that he vvil haue her definitiue ſentence ſo firme and inuiolable among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that he vvil not haue him accounted one of that number, who ſhal preuaricate or deſpiſe the ſame.

Secondly, it maketh alſo for theſe her prerogatiues, that al ſuch as haue obſtinately maintained any opinions condemned by the Church for hereſies, and conſequently haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeied her authority &amp; decrees, and beene by her adjudged <hi>Heretikes;</hi>

The priuileges and prerogatiues graunted by our Sauiour to his Apoſtles and Diſciples, confirme the ſame: for they are by him called the <hi>ſalt of the earth,</hi> and the <hi>light of the world:</hi> and being ſent to preach, they receaued from him this commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and approbation of their doctrine; <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me: and he that dispiſeth you, diſpiſeth me.</hi> Which wordes argue an infallible truth, although not in the doctrine of euery particuler Biſhop and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of the Church: yet in them altogether, when they repreſent the whole Church in a Councel; or in the whole number of them, although diuided &amp; ſeperated in place. For in theſe, like as in Chriſtes Apoſtles and Diſciples (as I haue aboue declared) the wordes alleaged muſt be verified, which cannot be done, if they al in euery ſenſe may erre.

that which now hath pleaſed the whole Church, which the authority of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures themſelues doth commend. That becauſe the Scripture cannot deceaue, whoſoeuer doth feare leaſt that he be deceaued through the obſcurity of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, may aſke counſaile touching it of the Church, whome without any doubt the Scripture it ſelfe doth ſhewe:</hi> Hitherto <hi>S. Augustine.</hi> Out of which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of his, we may gather this notable rule, that in al thinges doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and in al obſcure queſtions concerning faith and religion, we ought to enquire and ſearch forth the doctrine and beleefe of the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church, and imbrace the ſame, ſeeking no further warrant of ſecurity; becauſe the Scriptures demonſtrate her, and manifeſtly declare that her doctrine is true, and may ſecurely be followed without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of errour. Vnto theſe arguments brought out of the word of God, reaſon it ſelfe aſſenteth: for ſeing that for diuers reſpects, it was conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient that Chriſt our Lord ſhould not alwaies conuerſe on earth among vs, and in his owne perſon manage the affaires of the Church, it was neceſſary that he ſhould leaue among Chriſtians ſome certaine rule &amp; guide, whereby they might direct their faith, and ſome judge for the deciding of daylie controuerſies, which might ariſe touching matters of religion; whoſe judgement they might ſecurely followe without al danger of being deceaued. Neither can we imagine that Gods infinit wiſedome foreſeing al thinges and times to come, or his vnſpeakable goodnes and loue to his Church, could order thinges otherwiſe. And this infallible guide and ſupreame judge is the Church, including the <hi>Pope,</hi> and other her Biſhops and Prelates. It was alſo needfull, ſeing that the Church of Chriſt was to endure for euer (I meane on earth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the end of the world) and to be to al perſons, a perfect guide in al a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to ſaluation, that it ſhould be preſerued from falſe doctrine and ruine; otherwiſe it could not at al times haue performed theſe offices. Our aduerſaries wil anſwere, that the Church through falſe doctrine and ſuperſtition hath already periſhed; and not appeared in the world for diuers hundreds of yeares: but this I ſhal refute at large<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </note> The reaſon is, becauſe this aſſertion doth (after a ſort) bereaue the whole incarnation, life, and paſſion of our Sauiour, of their effect and end, which was principally to found a Church and Kingdome in this world, which ſhould endure vntil the day of judgement, and direct men in al truth to ſaluation. Wherefore, vvhoſoeuer affirmeth the Church to haue periſhed, taketh away this effect and prerogatiue from his incarnation, life, and paſſion, and auoucheth that at ſometimes, man had no meanes left to attaine to euerlaſting bliſſe; which is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the mercy and goodnes of God.

                  <p>I wil therefore conclude, that the Church of Chriſt is not ſubject to errour, touching matters of faith and religion; and conſequently, that euery man may ſecurely followe concerning ſuch matters, her ſentence and judgement. And this is that high beaten and plaine way to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was long ſince foretold by the Prophet <hi>Iſaias,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying of the Kingdome of Chriſt, vſeth theſe wordes.<note place="margin">

Wherefore, like as the action of a member of a mans body, is attributed to the vvhole (for although the hand ſtrike: yet, man is ſaid to ſtrike, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) ſo although we be inſtructed, &amp; taught by ſome particuler mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church; yet, vve may vvel ſay that this is done by the ſaid <hi>Catholike</hi> and vniuerſal Church.</p>

For ſeing that vnitie and conſent in faith, is farre more neceſſary then vnity and conſent in ceremonies, and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ordinances for gouernement; vve may truly affirme, that Chriſt vvas more careful for the preſeruation of the firſt, then of the ſecond.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19127:46"/>
for the firſt then for the ſecond (for they are principally concerning di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in truth) we doe followe reaſon and the holy Scripture in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the firſt, if they are not to be blamed for their maintenance of the ſecond. Seing moreouer, that <hi>Field</hi> and <hi>Powel</hi> giue the preſent Church in al ages, as great authority as it had the Apoſtles yet liuing, and they vvere then not only ordainers of poſitiue lawes and orders; but alſo infallible propounders of true doctrine, and directors in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of beleefe, we haue no reaſon according to their ground, to denie this prerogatiue to the ſame Church in al future times. Seing finally, that the <hi>Puritans</hi> denie the collection or deduction of either of theſe prerogatiues out of the Scripture, and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> auerre the plaine deduction of one, and for this the <hi>Puritans</hi> condemne the <hi>Protestants;</hi> we may wel imagine that the <hi>Puritans</hi> may erre in denying both, and that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are to graunt the one as wel as the other, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that the <hi>Catholike</hi> truth ſhould be imbraced by al.</p>

And to performe this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt in the firſt place, I demand whether there be or no, any ſuch Churches nowe extant in the world, of which the one inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth al faithful Chriſtians that are and haue beene ſince the aſcenſion of Chriſt: the other, al thoſe that are and haue beene ſince the Apoſtles daies? if there be not, then the promiſes of Chriſt cannot be verified of them: if there be, then I aſke further, vvhere they are to be found? Is the Church now in the world that hath beene in former ages? Are they that in times paſt flouriſhed, nowe members of the Church militant? They are not vvithout doubt. Wherefore, although theſe two diuers conſiderations of the Church, may be in our vnderſtanding: yet, there is no real object of them, nowe hauing any real being in the world, nor euer vvas at any one time: and ſeing that it is euident that the promiſes of Chriſt, are concerning the prerogatiues of ſome real body or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, hauing real being in the vvorld, and not only in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; it is alſo manifeſt, that they were not ſpoken of the Church in any one of thoſe two acceptions. Beſides this, howe ſhal vve ſeuer or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh theſe three conſiderations of the Church, really from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19127:47"/>
doth not the Church in the firſt acception comprehend the ſame Church, as it is taken in the ſecond and third ſignification? doth it not (as <hi>Field</hi> ſaith) <hi>comprehend al that are and euer haue beene ſince Chriſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the fleſh?</hi> if ſo, then without doubt alſo, that Church which hath bin in al particuler ages, and at al particuler times and inſtances, and is euen at this preſent. We muſt imagine (if I be not deceaued) the better to vnderſtand <hi>M. Field</hi> his meaning,<note place="margin">Vincent.

                     </note> as <hi>Vincentius Lirenenſis</hi> ſeemeth to inſinuate, that the beginning and progreſſe of the Church ſince her firſt planting, hath beene not much vnlike to the augmentation or growing of a child, from his firſt birth to his perfect ſtate or old age. And who can make any queſtion, but in the time of a mans being, from his birth vntil his old age, that time alſo is included, which was from the day in which he was weaned from his nurſes milke, vntil his ſaid old age? but if we admit this, howe can we chooſe but confeſſe, that the Church in the firſt acception, includeth alſo the ſame in the ſecond and third? and ſo I ſay, that the laſt is comprehended in the ſecond: howe then can he make the Church in the firſt ſignification, free from errour and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and not in the ſecond and third? or howe can he make it in the ſecond ſignification free from errour, and not in the third? and to make the matter a litle more euident: I demand of <hi>M. Field,</hi> whether a man might truly haue ſaid, at al times ſince the Apoſtles daies, the Church in the firſt and ſecond ſignification, is abſolutely free from al errour in diuine thinges? if he might not, then nothing more is attributed to the Church in theſe acceptions, then to the ſame in the laſt: if he might, then was the preſent Church in euery inſtant free from ſuch errours &amp; ignorance. For to inſiſt in the ſimilitude already made, to this that a man be ſaid to be ſound and in health, it is not ſufficient that in his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood or at ſome other time, he was ſo affected: but it is alſo neceſſary that he be ſound at that very time, when the ſentence is pronounced; and if the ſentence be pronounced of al his whole life, it cannot be true if once he were ſicke. In like ſort, to this that the Church as it includeth al times, ſince the Aſcention of Chriſt, or from the Apoſtles, be ſaid to be free from al errour: it is not ſufficient that in the firſt yeares, or at ſome time or other it was ſo: but it is alſo requiſite that ſhe be ſo nowe, and euer haue beene ſo; otherwiſe, if ſhe haue beene infected vvith errour at ſome one time, the ſaid errour maketh the propoſition falſe. And in very deed I cannot ſee, firſt, for what other reaſon he freeth the Church in the firſt ſignification from ignorance and errour; but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19127:47"/>
in reſpect of the Apoſtles daies, when it enjoied only (as he ſaith) ſuch priueledges: in like ſort, I can ſee no other reaſon why he freeth it in the ſecond acception from errour, but this; that at ſome time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in ſome place or other, true doctrine hath beene or is taught in her, concerning euery article of faith. For he maketh the preſent Church, at al times ſubject to errour, and conſequently, he wil not giue this priueledge to the preſent Church of al times. And this he ſemeth to confeſſe in thoſe his vvords of the eleauenth chapter, where he ſaith, that the Church in the ſecond acception is infallibly true. <hi>Not in reſpect of the condition of the men of whome it conſiſteth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Booke <hi>4.</hi> chap. <hi>11.</hi> §. that the authority.</note> 
                     <hi>or the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the guiding of the spirit, (each particuler man being ſubject to errour) but in reſpect of the generality, and vniuerſality of it, in euery part wherof in euery time no errour could poſsibly be found:</hi> that is (if I wel vnderſtand him,) that ſome part or other, at ſome time or other, was free from euery errour, not al; nor perhappes any part from al errours at the ſame time. Marke well, what a proper prerogatiue is finally giuen to the Church in thoſe acceptions, in vvhich he doth ſo highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt it, to vvit; that it vvas free from errour and ignorance in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles daies, and free from errour in reſpect of the generality and vniuerſality of it, becauſe no errour could poſſibly be found in it in euery part, in euery time. What improper kinde of ſpeeches be theſe? can a ſicke man be ſaid to be ſound, becauſe he vvas found in his childe-hood? or can he be ſaide to haue beene euer ſound, if once he vvere ſicke? or can he be called a ſound man, that hath had at one time his head ſound, at another time his armes, and at other times other members, although he neuer had his vvhole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at one time ſound together? Beſides, vvhat vveake priueledges are here giuen to the Church? are they anſvverable to the promiſes of Chriſt, and other teſtimonies and reaſons aboue recited, for her infallible and diuine authority? hath he beſtovved no greater prerogatiues vpon his ſpiritual <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spouſe?</hi> but perhaps theſe prerogatiues redound greatly to the good and benefite of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and children of the Church. Neither this can be auerred true: for vvhat are poore Chriſtians the nearer for it? howe can ſuch a Church be the director of their faith? howe ſhal they knowe vvhat faith vvas preached by the Apoſtles? and vvhat part taught true doctrine, and vvhen and vvhich erred in ſubſequent ages? howe ſhal vve vnderſtand her judicial ſentence, vvhen controuerſies ariſe and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19127:48"/>
are to be decided? ſurely they that are paſt, and are departed out of this world, can performe theſe thinges by no other meanes, but by their writinges left behind them: wherefore, we can take no other direction, and receiue no other judicial ſentence from the Church in the firſt and ſecond acception, but by ſuch monuments and bookes, as we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from the Apoſtles, Euangeliſtes, the ancient Fathers and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and other our predeceſſours. And vvhat is this? but to reduce al to the letter of holy Scripture, and to the workes of antiquity, which (as I wil prooue hereafter, ſetting aſide the authority of the preſent Church) yeelde vs no certaine and diuine argument; and to giue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at al to the Church it ſelfe, contrary to al the argumentes before made for her infallible authority. Finally, ſome of the places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before aleadged, are expreſly ſpoken of the preſent Church, as that: <hi>tel the Church; If he ſhal not heare the Church, let him he to thee as the</hi> Heathen <hi>or</hi> Publican, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

For what diſſention and diuiſion would ariſe of this? might not euery man contradict the rule of faith in any matter whatſoeuer, and affirme his contradiction to be in a matter of ſmal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? who ſhal judge which matters be of great, and which of ſmal importance?

                     <hi>SECTION THE SEAVENTH.</hi> That to ſaluation it is neceſſary to beleeue the whole Catholike faith, and euery article thereof.</head>
                  <p>CONCERNING the third point vvhich I intended to proue; I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that it is neceſſary to ſaluation to beleeue and hold, either expreſly or virtually, euery article of faith which is propounded by the Church to her children to be beleeued: I adde thoſe wordes (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly or virtually) becauſe I ſay not, that euery man is bound expreſly to knowe al the articles of Chriſtian religion. For it is held by vs ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient if the ruder ſort knowe expreſly certaine of the principal: as are they that concerne the Trinity, and the incarnation, paſſion, reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and aſcenſion of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if they virtually beleeue al the reſt, that is; if they beleeue (concerning al ſuch points as they are not bound expreſly to know) whatſoeuer according to the doctrine of the church ought to be beleeued; and be of contrary beleefe in no one point pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto them, and knowne to be propounded as an article of faith. We differ therefore from our aduerſaries in this, that ſome of them hold a man is not bound to belieue any ſuch articles not neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be knowne by al; others ſay a man may erre in them, ſo long as he ſeeth not apparantly his errour condemned by Scripture, or plainely proued falſe by euident deduction out of thoſe articles, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly to be knowne and beleeued. But the truth of this mine aſſertion, is gathered out of that which hath beene already proued. For if the Church be <hi>the ground and piller of truth,</hi> and cannot erre in faith, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that al her beleefe may ſafely without danger of errour, be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And moreouer, becauſe God hath reuealed ſuch articles to the Church for no other end, then that her children by the beleefe of them may attaine to euerlaſting bliſſe, it is alſo euident, that euery one is bound to beleeue whatſoeuer ſhe teacheth. I adde alſo, that whoſoeuer beleeueth not al, hath no faith: and that he who thinketh it to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſaluation, to beleeue certaine principal articles of Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, although the reſt be denied, muſt needes accuſe the Church of errour; and ſo according to his owne opinion, cleane ouerthrowe her. The firſt is eaſily proued, becauſe he that beleeueth not God and his Church in one point, certainely beleeueth them in none. For howe is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19127:49"/>
it poſſible that he can reject them in any, if he beleeue their authority to be infallible? Wherefore, by rejecting their judgement and ſentence concerning one article, he plainely declareth that he beleeueth not the reſt, becauſe they are propounded vnto him by the Church and reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God; but becauſe they pleaſe his owne fancy, and in his owne judgement he thinketh them true and credible: of which it followeth, that he hath no faith, which (as I haue aboue declared) maketh vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the miſteries of our beleefe, becauſe they are reuealed by God. And this we may gather out of thoſe wordes of <hi>S. Iames</hi> the Apoſtle: <hi>He that offendeth in one, is made guilty of al.</hi>

                  <p>Further, that whoſoeuer thinketh it ſufficient to ſaluation, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue certaine principal articles of Chriſtian religion, although the reſt be denied, accuſeth the Church of errour, thus I declare.<note place="margin">

                  <p>For the reſolution of this queſtion, I haue affirmed in the title of this Chapter, that the firſt ſuch particuler ground, is the holy Scripture: And although there be no controuerſie betweene vs and our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, concerning the authority of diuers bookes of the ſaid holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19127:51"/>
(for moſt of them by vs al are confeſſed to be Canonical) yet, much difference there is betweene vs, concerning the meanes by vvhich vve knowe the holie Scripture, and euery parcel thereof to be the true vvord of God, and vvho is to be judge of the true ſence of theſe diuine volumes: vvherefore, theſe points are briefly to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and diſcuſſed. Howe then doe vve knowe, that the old and newe Teſtament are Canonical? howe can vve certainely aſſure our ſelues, that the Apoſtles and Diſciples vvrote the newe? vvhat proofe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe haue vve to perſwade vs, that no part of the holie Scripture hath beene in times paſt corrupted or depraued? I anſwere in fewe vvordes, that al this is infallibly knowne vnto vs, by the authority and judgement of the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church, vvho hath adjudged al ſuch bookes to be Canonical, and as Canonical receiued them, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered them to her children. I denie not, but the Scriptures before the definition and cenſure of the Church, vvere true, and contained the certaine and ſincere vvord of God: but this only I ſay, that this truth and authority, was firſt infallibly knowne vnto vs by the Church, vvho adjudged and cenſured them to be as they are, and as ſuch commanded al Chriſtians to eſteeme and reuerence them. Neither is this any waies prejudicial to the dignity and authority of the holie Scripture: for this notwithſtanding vve confeſſe, that the ſaid Scripture is of farre greater authority, then the Church or her definitions be; vvhich is manifeſt, becauſe although the holie Ghoſt aſſiſt and direct, both the vvriters of holie Scripture and the Church: yet certaine it is, that hee hath aſſiſted and directed the firſt, after a farre more excellent manner then he doth the ſecond, becauſe his aſſiſtance and direction in penning thoſe ſacred bookes vvas ſuch, that euery ſentence in them contained, is of moſt certaine verity; but his aſſiſtance vnto the Church, vvhether it be in a general Councel, or otherwiſe in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> maketh only that vvhich the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel or Biſhop intend to define, of ſuch an infallible truth. Wherefore then doe vve proue the Scripture to be Canonical by the authority of the Church? Surely for no other reaſon, then becauſe the Church is better knowne vnto vs then the Scripture: For the Church hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies beene (as I vvil proue hereafter) moſt viſible and apparant to the vvhole vvorld; euery man alſo, before that the newe Teſtament vvas written, &amp; before that it vvas generally receiued by the Church, might haue knowne the Church (for ſhe vvas before any part of it was
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19127:51"/>
penned) and conſequently by her infallible judgement, euery one might with farre more eaſe and certainety, haue come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſuch bookes, then by any other meanes or induſtry. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conclude, although the Church maketh not Scripture; yet, of her we learne moſt certainely which is Scripture. And this is no more diſgrace vnto Scripture, then it was vnto Chriſt that the Apoſtles gaue teſtimony of him, becauſe they were better knowne then he. I adde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that euery one of them, who aboue al others reprehend this our aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, taketh vpon himſelfe as great authority ouer Scriptures, as vve giue to the whole Church.<note place="margin">See part ſecond chap. <hi>5.</hi> Sect. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> For euery newe ſectarie out of his owne fancy judgeth this to be Scripture, that to be none, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> vvhich muſt needes be in euery mans judgement farre more abſurd.</p>
                  <p>This aſſertion being thus explicated, let vs nowe briefly proue the ſame: And firſt, becauſe vve can aſſigne no other meanes by vvhich vve may ſay, that vve certainely knowe the Scripture to be Canonical, but the authority of the Church. And as concerning the old Teſtament, although vve graunt that the authority thereof, vvas firſt partly approued by miracles, partly by the teſtimony of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and partly by the authority of the Church in thoſe daies: yet, howe doe vve nowe infallibly knowe that it vvas ſo approued, and that it is the ſelfe ſame nowe that vvas then approued, but by the relation, tradition, and cenſure of the Church?</p>
                  <p>But let vs come to the newe Teſtament, and demand vvho hath receiued it into the Canon of holie Scripture? vvhat miracles haue beene vvrought to proue it Canonical? who doth aſſure vs, that it vvas penned by the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt? and that ſince their daies it hath not beene corrupted? Verily, the Church only reſolueth vs of al theſe queſtions, and telleth vs vvith aſſurance of truth, that the ſaid newe Teſtament vvas vvritten by the ſaid ſacred authours, inſpired and directed by the holy Ghoſt: and that euer ſince their daies, it hath beene preſerued in her ſacred boſome vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out corruption. And no other anſwere hauing any probability of truth, and ſufficient to ſatisfie a reaſonable mans vnderſtanding, can be made. This may alſo be confirmed by the continual practiſe of the Church: For no man can deny but it vvas her doing, that the foure Goſpels of <hi>S. Mathewe, Marke, Luke,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See part <hi>2</hi> chap. <hi>5.</hi> Sect. <hi>2.</hi>

                     <hi>M. Field</hi> in his fourth booke of the Church occurreth and ſaith, that the ſenſe and meaning of <hi>S.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19127:52"/>
the reaſon vſed by <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> which is this. <hi>Manichaeus</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his epiſtle, which this moſt learned Doctor confuteth, called himſelfe <hi>an Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> requireth a proofe of his Apoſtleſhip; and vrgeth (if perhaps <hi>he alleage ſome authority out of the Goſpel</hi>) what he would doe to him that ſhould deny the Goſpel: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he adjoineth the wordes rehearſed. <hi>I trulie would not beleeue the Goſpel</hi> &amp;c. <hi>if the authority of the Church did not moue me thereunto.</hi> And out of this that the Goſpel is beleeued by the authoritie of the Church, he proueth that <hi>Manichaeus</hi> is not to be beleeued, becauſe the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie which commaundeth to doe the one, forbiddeth to doe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Of which it followeth, that if it erre in the laſt, it may alſo erre in the firſt; and ſo no firme argument can be brought out of it, for the proofe of the Apoſtleſhip of <hi>Manichaeus.</hi> Hence S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth not ſay, I had not beleued the Goſpel, except the authority of the Church had moued me thereunto, as he ſhould haue ſaid if he had meant as <hi>Field</hi> pretendeth; but <hi>I would not beleeue the Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. taking his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the motiue of his preſent beliefe of the Goſpel: and in this ſence his reaſon is of great force, and not otherwiſe. But that which I ſay, is yet more confirmed by that which followeth: For S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> addeth. <hi>But if peraduenture thou canſt finde ſomething in the Goſpel, moſt apparant for the Apoſtleſhip of</hi> Manichaeus, <hi>thou ſhalt weaken vnto me the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the</hi> Catholikes, <hi>who commaund me that I ſhal not beleeue thee; which being weakned, now neither can I beleeue the Goſpel becauſe through them I beleeued it. So whatſoeuer thou ſhalt bring me from thence, ſhalbe with me of no force: wherefore, if nothing manifeſt be found in the Goſpel for the Apoſtleſhip of</hi> Manichaeus, <hi>I wil beleeue the</hi> Catholikes <hi>rather then thee. But if thou bring any thing from thence manifeſt for the Apostleſhip of</hi> Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus, <hi>I wil neither beleeue them nor thee: not them, becauſe they haue lied to me concerning thee; not thee alſo, becauſe thou bringeſt me forth that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which I beleeued through them, whome I haue found liars. But God forbid that I ſhould not beleeue the Goſpel.</hi> Hitherto are <hi>S. Augustines</hi> words; by which (I thinke) euerie man may perceiue, how greatly <hi>M. Field</hi> doth wrong him. For we ſee plainly, that he confeſſeth the authority of the Church, to haue beene the cauſe of his preſent beliefe of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; yet not the formal cauſe, but the conditional, as is declared before. And al that I haue here related out of this holy Father,<note place="margin">Aug. tom. <hi>6.</hi> li. cont.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19127:53"/>
any one of their Hereſies, by weakning and ouerthrowing her authoritie, weakeneth alſo and ouerthroweth the authoritie of the whole Bible. Neither doth that which he alleageth out of <hi>Waldenſis</hi> make any waies for him: for as this learned man plainely in that very place declareth, he vnderſtandeth <hi>S. Augustine</hi> as I haue deliuered: Theſe are his wordes.<note place="margin">Waldenſis lib. <hi>2.</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinalis fidei artic. <hi>2.</hi> ca. <hi>21.</hi>

                     <hi>Without the authority of the vniuerſal Church, no ſcripture can be read or bad for certaine:</hi> And this <hi>S. Augustine</hi> vnderſtood when he ſaid. <hi>I would not beleeue the Goſpel, did not the authority of the Church moue me thereunto:</hi> Thus <hi>Waldenſis.</hi> The point which <hi>Field</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, is in his diſcourſe following, but it maketh nothing againſt vs; for he only ſaith that which I haue before deliuered, to wit: that by the propoſition of the Church, we firſt come to a certaine and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural knowledge of ſuch bookes as are Canonical, and then beleeue the verities in them contained, becauſe they are reuealed by God: like as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> firſt beleeued through the relation of the woman with whom our Sauiour talked,<note place="margin">Iob. ca. <hi>4.</hi> ver. <hi>39.</hi> &amp;c.</note> as the propounder of ſuch things as ſhe had heard of our Lord; afterward through the diuine ſpeeches which he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to them himſelf. That which <hi>Field</hi> ſaith before, that <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of ſome Diuines) ſpeaketh here of the church, taken for the whole number of beleeuers that are and haue beene, ſince Chriſt appeared in the fleſh, ſo including the Apoſtles, is friuolous: both becauſe <hi>S. Augustine</hi> neuer vſed the wordes <hi>Catholike</hi> Church, after this ſort in that ſenſe; and alſo becauſe the argument had beene of no force;<note place="margin">See S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust. in li. <hi>23.</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra Faustum cap. <hi>9.</hi>
                     </note> vnto which I adde further, that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> ſpeaketh of that Church, which commaunded him then not to beleeue <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> which was the preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Church as appeareth. Neither can he (as I think) alleage any Diuine that euer ſo interpreted it. For that which he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the margent out of <hi>Occam</hi> is very impertinent: and thus much of this teſtimony of <hi>S. Augustine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Hieron. in ſimbolo ad Damaſum</note>
                     <hi>S. Hierome</hi> likewiſe, auoucheth himſelfe <hi>to receiue the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament in that number of books, which the authority of the holie</hi> Catholike <hi>Church doth deliuer.</hi> And this reaſon ſo infallibly proueth, that theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine bookes containe the true word of God, that euery one may moſt aſſuredly beleeue it. For her cenſure and declaration cannot be falſe, who by God himſelfe is warranted from errour.</p>
                  <p>Finally, vnto this principal and inuincible argument, I might alſo adde the tradition of the Church, and one conſent of holy Fathers, who haue deliuered to their ſucceſſors, and confirmed by their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19127:53"/>
that theſe holy bookes were penned by the inſtinct of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; which argument of tradition for the proofe of Canonical bookes, was vſed by <hi>Serapion, Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> and <hi>Origenes,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> recordeth.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Euſebius li.</hi> 6. <hi>hiſt. cap.</hi> 10. 11. 18.</note> But this argument is almoſt the ſame with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: for the certainty of the tradition of the Church, and of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the ancient fathers, dependeth of this, that the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre. For if we make her judgement ſubject to errour, her tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the whole conſent of fathers, may likewiſe be erroneous: but ſuppoſing the Church cannot erre, this argument is of as great force, but almoſt the ſame with the firſt. And hence I inferre againſt our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, that no bookes of the old and newe Teſtament receiued by the Church as canonical, are to be rejected; for ſeing that the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority hath approued them al, they are al with like reaſon to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: neither hath any man more reaſon to reject one, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And thus much of the letter of holy Scripture.</p>

                  <p>And this obſcurity of holy Scripture is a thing ſo euident, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, euen of our aduerſaries themſelues (although others wil haue them eaſie) are forced in expreſſe and plaine termes to confeſſe it.

                     </note> yea, almoſt al the newe ſectaries by their proceedinges, ſeeme to acknowledge this truth: for otherwiſe, what meane they to write ſuch great and huge volumes or commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries vpon the holy Scripture? But whence ariſeth this difficulty and obſcurity? ſurelie of diuers cauſes. Firſt, becauſe ſundrie wordes of Scriptures, admit many ſenſes, and the very phraſe it ſelfe is obſcure and doubtful. Secondly, many ſentences in it are <hi>prophetical,</hi> many <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolical,</hi>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:19127:54"/>
many <hi>metaphorical,</hi> which commonlie are ful of obſcuritie. Thirdly, it is proper to Scripture to haue many ſenſes vnder one letter, as the <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe, which is that which the holy writer firſt intended: and this ſenſe ſometimes is ſignified by proper words; ſometimes by wordes metaphorical and improper, yea ſometimes the <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe of the ſame wordes is diuers. It hath alſo a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſenſe, which is that which is ſignified by the thinges vnder the letter. And this ſenſe is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>moral,</hi> which is called alſo <hi>tropological,</hi> when it tendeth to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: or <hi>allegorical,</hi> when it tendeth to faith, or the Church; or <hi>anago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical,</hi> when it tendeth to heauen or life euerlaſting. For example, this vvord <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> literally ſignifieth the Cittie ſo called, morally the ſoule of man, allegorically the Church militant, and anagogically the Church triumphant. Al theſe ſenſes the wordes of Scripture beare; and diuers of them not ſeldome, were intended by the holy Ghoſt in the ſame ſentence. And what a difficult matter is it, to diſcerne them? I adde finally, that ſundrie miſteries deliuered vnto vs in holy writ, are high and aboue the reach of our natural reaſon: Wherefore it is no meruaile if the ſentences in which they are diſcloſed, be hard and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure.

                  <p>Moreouer, that the judgement of euery priuate man (as before) is ſubject vnto errour and falſhood in his tranſlation, or interpretation of holy Scripture, it is graunted by ſome of our aduerſaries, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe eaſily proued: Firſt, becauſe he Scripture it ſelfe warranteth no priuate mans judgement from errour.

conſidering vvhether they be conſonant, or no, to the doctrine of the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church, or the rule of faith, receiued by tradition from the Apoſtles.

                  <p>But vvhat doe I vſe many wordes in a matter ſo euident, gathered out of our aduerſaries owne proceedinges? For the holy Ghoſt tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth men but one truth: ſeing therefore, that there are among the newe Sectaries now in the vvorld, ſo great diſſentions and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in opinions, concerning the expoſition of the ſelfe ſame wordes of Scripture; it neceſſarily followeth, that ſome of them expound the Scriptures falſlie: and ſeing that one of them hath no better war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for his direction in truth, then another; vve may vvel affirme them al to be ſubject to errour and falſehood.

                  <p>NOVVE, ſeing that the Scripture of it ſelfe is hard, and euerie particuler man may erre in the expoſition of it: ſeing alſo that the falſe vnderſtanding of it is ſo dangerous, and the true ſenſe ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, let vs ſee whether we can finde out any certaine and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible guide, whoſe judgement we may follow ſecurely, and without al feare of errour in this matter.</p>
                  <p>I affirme therefore, that like as we receiue the letter of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, from the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church, and by her cenſure infallibly knowe it to be Canonical: ſo likewiſe we are to receiue the ſenſe and expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſaid letter, from the ſame our holy mother; and receiuing and following the ſenſe by her approued, we cannot poſſibly erre: wherefore, vpon it we may ſecurely build our faith and ſaluation. This may be inferred out of thoſe thinges which haue beene already proued: for if the letter it ſelfe be not properly Scripture without the true ſenſe, which is (as it were) the life and ſoule of the ſaid letter; and the letter be knowne vnto vs by the declaration of the Church, it muſt needes followe, that we ought alſo to receiue the ſenſe from the ſame Church: But let vs proue it out of the holy Scripture. Firſt therefore, we gather out of the Apoſtle, that Scripture ought to be interpreted according to the rule of faith generally receiued in the Church: his wordes are theſe.<note place="margin">

Truly, the meaning of them is already explicated: for by them we are taught, that the expoſition of holie Scriptures, ought to be conformable to that rule of faith, which was deliuered by Chriſt to his Church, and by the aſſiſtance and direction of the holy Ghoſt, hath remained in the ſame euer ſince, vvithout corruption, and ſhal ſo remaine vntil the end of the world. And al this may be confirmed by that ſentence of <hi>S. Peter</hi> before alleaged:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.</note> 
                     <hi>No pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of Scripture is made by priuate intepretation:</hi> that is to ſay, no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Scripture, ought to be made acording to any mans priuate fancie, but according to the doctrine &amp; ſenſe of the Church. And by this rule (as I haue before noted) <hi>S.

And what judge can we imagine him to haue appointed, but the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike</hi> Church? whom (as I haue proued aboue) he hath warranted from errour, whoſe authority he hath made the rule of our beliefe, who hath the cuſtody of holy Scriptures, and from whom we receiue them, and infallibly know them to containe the true word of God. This finally, the practiſe it ſelfe of the Church hath confirmed: for whenſoeuer any controuerſy hath riſen touching the true ſenſe of holy Scriptures, ſhe (according to the rule of faith in her preſerued, and the ſenſe of Scripture vnto her deliuered, together with the letter) hath defined the truth and decided the ſame, as it appeareth by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation (al <hi>Heretikes,</hi> together with their falſe tranſlations, and erroneous expoſitions of the ſaid Scriptures.

                  <p>BVT here occurreth a difficulty of no ſmal moment to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: For in this chapter I haue affirmed, the Canonical Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and their true interpretation, to he knowne by the infallible authoritie of the Church, whereas before I proued the authority of the Church to be infallible, by the teſtimonie of holie Scripture: vvherefore,<note place="margin">Field book <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> it may ſeeme that I haue made a circle, or (as <hi>M. Field</hi> calleth it) a circulation.</p>
                  <p>The ful ſolution of this objection, dependeth of the reſolution of a queſtion, vvhich to ſome appeareth very intricate and hard, to wit: vnto what vve laſtlie reſolue our faith, vvhether to the authority of the Church, or of the Scripture, or to ſome humane motiues? and therefore this muſt firſt be diſcuſſed, before the other can be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And in verie deede, although al <hi>Catholike</hi> Diuines be of one conſent, and hold that the cauſe of our beliefe is the authority of God, which hath reuealed ſuch miſteries as we beleeue: yet concerning the laſt reſolution of our faith, which is a ſchoole queſtion, and not a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith, I finde among them two opinions. The followers of the firſt declare the matter thus.</p>
                  <p>Fiiſt (ſay they) euery man is induced to beleeue Chriſtian religion, and to accept of it as true, by certaine humane and prudent motiues
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19127:59"/>
or reaſons which perſwade him, that ſuch doctrine as is taught in the Church according to the rules of wiſedome, is credible and worthie of beliefe. Such motiues among others, are theſe which followe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that almoſt al Nations, and in them an infinite number of men of greateſt authority, principal wit, excellent vertue, and profound learning haue ſo beleeeued. Secondly, that innumerable multitudes of people of al ſortes, ſexes and ages, vvho vvere moſt deſirous to pleaſe God and knowe true religion, and vvere exemplars or pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of probity and ſanctitie, haue ſo earneſtlie embraced it, that they doubted not to preferre the profeſſion of it, before goodes, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, fame, and life it ſelfe: yea, that they choſe rather to looſe al theſe, and endure vvithal moſt cruel torments, then to depart from it. Thirdly, that it doth (as it vvere) miraculouſlie and by ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine meanes, change men (although habituated in vice) vpon the ſodaine to be vertuous. Fourthly, that the propagation of it hath beene by diuine power: which appeareth by this, that a fewe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and vveake fiſher-men, teaching ſuch thinges as are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to fleſh and bloud, and aboue al reaſon; haue ouercome, not by force of armes, but by preaching and ſuffering, the vviſeſt, moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent, moſt noble, and moſt potent men of the vvorld. Finally, that this religion hath beene confirmed by an infinite multitude of diuine miracles, recorded by famous authors of al ages, of vvhich if one only be confeſſed true, Chriſtian religion cannot be falſe. By theſe, and other ſuch like reaſons and argumentes, which I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed before, according to the Pſalme: <hi>The teſtimonies of our Lord are firſt made</hi> (vnto wel diſpoſed people) <hi>ouer or exceeding credible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But although theſe of themſelues, may vvel make vs accept and beleeue the truth of Chriſtian religion, by a natural and humane kinde of beliefe, ſuch as the Deuil himſelfe hath, and is alſo in <hi>Heretikes</hi> concerning ſuch articles which they truly beleeue: yet can they not alone, cauſe in vs an act of ſupernatural faith. For this (as I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before) being ſupernatural, can not proceed from a natural cauſe, without ſome ſupernatural helpe. And vvhat then is done after this perſwaſion? Verily God almighty yeeld eth vs his ſupernatural helpe, and imparteth vnto our ſoule a diuine light of faith, by which our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is made more capable of things ſo high, then before; and by which our mindes are ſo diuinely lifted vp and affected (as it were) by a diuine teſtimonie, that through it, farre more ſtrongly then by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19127:60"/>
any humane motiues, we are inclined to beleeue, and made moſt firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reſt in the diuine reuelation: and ſo by this aſſiſtance of God, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the concourſe of our vnderſtanding, an act of ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faith is produced, by which we firmely beleeue the articles of Chriſtian faith, taught and propounded by the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church; not for ſuch and ſuch motiues as before proued them credible, but for that they are reuealed by almighty God. And becauſe one of theſe articles is, that the Church in propounding particuler miſteries of our faith, cannot erre; this alſo is beleeued among the reſt: vpon which as a common rule and guide, we ground our beliefe, as vpon a ſure propounder of ſuch thinges as we are bound to beleeue, touching e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie other particuler article. Hence ariſeth a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs and ſome of the moſt learned of our aduerſaries, touching the deciſion of this queſtion: for although we both ſeeme to admit ſome ſupernatural aide, light, or habite to this, that our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding produce an act of ſupernatural faith: yet, we differ much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the object of this act; as alſo in the motiues or arguments of credibility, which firſt induce vs to accept of the ſame. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we include in the firſt act of faith, into which we are induced by the ſaid motiues, the beliefe of an infallible guide touching al parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer pointes: they include no ſuch matter; but for their ground and guide in this act beleeued, acknowledge only the letter of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: which verilie, although we alſo in our aforeſaid act include; yet we giue it no ſuch ſole preheminence, as is before declared. And of this followeth a farre greater difference, couching the arguments and proofes of our propounder and ground: for whereas althe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of credibility, perſwading vs that Chriſtian religion is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, perſwade vs alſo, that the authority of the propounder of our faith (I meane of the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church) according to prudence, may be beleeued infalliblie: the ſaid arguments are not ſufficient in a wiſe mans judgement (ſetting aſide the ſaid authoritie of the Church) to make it credible vnto vs, that euerie booke and parcel of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture commonly admitted, is canonicall and diuine; much leſſe, that euerie particuler expoſition of Scripture by euerie priuate man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, is diuine &amp; true. And of this it proceedeth, that they alleage no ſuch forcible arguments of credibility, for the proofe of this and that booke of Scripture; nor for the truth of their interpretation of this and that ſentence, but for the firſt, vſually flie to diuine illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19127:60"/>
only, joyned with the majeſtie of the letter, or ſome ſuch thing, vvhich be no ſuch arguments of credibility as I wil proue hereafter:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Part.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.</note> and for the laſt, ſome of them aſſigne certaine rules to be obſerued, vvhich (in verie deede) are inſufficient, as ſhal likewiſe hereafter be proued. Hence they aſſigne no prudent motiues,<note place="margin">Ibid. c. <hi>8.</hi>
                     </note> which perſwade them to concurre with the ſupernatural helpe of God, to a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural act of faith:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>verſe</hi> 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>verſe</hi> 1.</note> Whereas God (although he require of men an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble obſequie or obedience to faith) yet propoundeth nothing to be beleeued, which in the judgement of wiſe men is not credible; and therefore alſo requireth a reaſonable obſequie. Verily if there were no other reaſon to perſwade a man the truth of our doctrine, this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would ſuffice, that God doth vſually teach al by ſome common rule or meane, which draweth men to vnity and humility; not euerie one by priuate illumination or inſpiration, which is commonlie a motiue to pride and a fountaine of diſcord.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Field</hi> vrgeth,<note place="margin">Field book <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> that by this doctrine we laſtly reſolue our faith to humane motiues and inducements. I anſwere, that concerning this matter two queſtions may be demaunded, very much diuers. Firſt, what moueth men to accept of the beliefe of ſuch obſcure articles, as are thoſe of Chriſtian religion? vnto which I make this anſwere, that vnto this they are moued by ſuch prudential or humane motiues, as I haue aſſigned before. Secondly, it may be asked concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal cauſe of faith it ſelfe, why men now actually beleeue ſuch obſcure miſteries? And vnto this I ſay, that the cauſe of their preſent beliefe, is the reuelation of God, or (vvhich is al one) the authority of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealing. And becauſe they are not ſufficient of themſelues, ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to beleeue ſuch articles as ſo reuealed, their vnderſtanding is aided and inclined to this, by the diuine gift of ſupernatural faith, like as their wil by charity, is aided and inclined to any act of ſupernatural loue; which gift of faith together with their vnderſtanding (as I haue ſaid) produceth a ſupernatural act of beliefe: wherfore, we aſſigne not humane inducements as the formal cauſe, but as the cauſe of the firſt acceptaunce of our faith; and as into the formal cauſe, we laſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue our faith into diuine reuelation: And ſo I thinke this opinion ſufficiently explicated. But before I paſſe any further,<note place="margin">Field ibid. § Surely. Stapheton in his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plic. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker pag. <hi>188.</hi>
                     </note> I cannot there but aduertiſe my reader, that <hi>Field</hi> diſcourſing of this point, wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>D. Stapleton</hi> very much. For whereas he accuſeth him, as though in his Triplication againſt <hi>Whitaker</hi> he ſhould affirme, <hi>Other matters to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19127:61"/>
be beleeued, becauſe contained in the Scripture; and the Scripture, becauſe it is the word of God; and that it is the word of God becauſe the Church deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth it ſo to be; and the Church, becauſe it is led by the ſpirit; and that it is led by the ſpirit, becauſe it is ſo contained in the Scripture and the Creed. Stapleton</hi> (in verie deed) in this laſt place hath no mention of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but of the Creed only. True it is that he proueth againſt <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker</hi> out of the Scriprture, a certaine internal motion of God, by which we are moued to aſſent to this firſt propoſition (as he ſaith) of our faith: <hi>I beleeue the</hi> Catholike <hi>Church is infallibly gouerned by the holy Ghoſt, and that ſhe is to be heard, and her voice obeyed:</hi> but this is not to ſay, that we beleeue the Church to be led by the ſpirit, becauſe it is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the ſecond opinion: Others therefore beſides this diuine affection or inclination, proceeding from the peculiar aſſiſtance of God in the act of faith, being deſirous alſo to aſſigne ſome other diuine and infallible reaſon, mouing vs to beleeue; affirme, both that we beleeue the authority of the Church to be infallible, becauſe it is ſo reuealed in holy Scripture; and alſo, that we infalliblie knowe the Scriptures to be canonical, becauſe as canonical they are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto vs by the Church. Neither doe they (as they ſay) in this kinde of proceeding, commit anie abſurd or vitious circle: becauſe theſe two thinges are not motiues or reaſons of the beliefe of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, after the ſelfe ſame manner, but in two ſundrie reſpects; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, that we yeeld the reaſon why the Church cannot erre, by the Scriptures (as by a diuine reuelation) approuing it. For although we formally beleeue this, becauſe it is reuealed by God; yet, this reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation vve proue by other reuelations contained in holy Scripture: but that the Scripture is canonical, although we formallie beleeue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath ſo reuealed; yet, this reuelation we proue not by any other reuelation, but by the authority of the Church, as a condition only requiſite, propounding it infallibly vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>To make this aſſertion a little more plaine, we muſt preſuppoſe the truth of two propoſitions, commonly held certaine in Philoſophy: the one is, that two cauſes may for diuers reſpects, be cauſes of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; ſo ſay the Philoſophers: the efficient cauſe is the cauſe of the being or exiſtence the final cauſe; and the final cauſe of the cauſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the efficient. For example, when a Phiſition doth adminiſter phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke to one that is ſicke, the final cauſe or end why he adminiſtreth
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19127:61"/>
phiſicke, is the health of the patient; and the adminiſtring of the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, is the efficient cauſe of the ſicke-mans health. In like ſort, when the winde openeth a window, it openeth it by entring in, and ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in by opening it, ſo that the efficient cauſe of the opening the window, is the motion of the entrance of the winde, and the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al cauſe and meane by which the winde entreth, is the opening of the window, becauſe vnleſſe the window be opened, the winde cannot enter in. Secondly, it is alſo certaine that a meere condition neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily requiſite, is no cauſe: for example, wood cannot be burned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be put neare, or in the fire; and yet this approximation (as I may cal it) is not the cauſe to ſpeake properly, why the wood is burnt but a condition neceſſarie. In like ſort, a lawe doth not binde except it be promulgated; and yet the promulgation is not the cauſe why the law doth binde, but a condition <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now to come to the matter: If two cauſes (in ſome ſort) may be cauſes of one another; wherefore may not we proue two propoſitions for diuers reſpects, by one another?</p>
                  <p>That theſe reſpects be diuers in the proofe of the infallible authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church by Scripture, and of Scripture by the infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, it is manifeſt; becauſe the infallible authority of the Church is proued by Scripture, as by a diuine reuelation; the Scripture by the infallible authority of the church, as by a condition requiſite: and that a cauſe and a condition be different I haue ſhewed. We ſay therefore, that Chriſt departing out of this vvorld, left the whole ſumme of Chriſtian doctrine with his holy ſpouſe the Church, and made her the infallible propounder of the ſame. And being ſo that among other articles left, this was one, that ſhe ſhould not erre in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting her office: this alſo ſhe was to propound, and her children by the diuine precept of God were bound to beleeue it: Wherefore, if in thoſe daies, before any Scripture of the new Teſtament was written, a man had asked a Chriſtian why he beleeued the miſteries of Chriſtian religion? he might truly haue anſwered, becauſe they were reuealed by God. If he had beene further demaunded, how he knew ſuch and ſuch articles to be reuealed? he might haue anſwered, becauſe the Church propounded them to be beleeued: ſo that the cauſe why he beleeued ſuch miſteries, was the reuelation of God: the meane where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he knew them infallibly to be reuealed, was the propounding of the Church. If he had bin vrged further, why he beleeued that the Church in propounding ſuch matters could not erre? Surely he might
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19127:62"/>
haue ſaid, that this was before included in the beliefe of the miſteries of Chriſtian religion in general; and conſequently was beleeue becauſe God ſo reuealed: but let vs come to the ſucceeding ages. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles &amp; diſciples of Chriſt whiles they liued, wrote the holy Scriptures of the new Teſtament, and left them to the Church; in which among other miſteries, they confirmed vnto vs the authority of the Church: and the Church propounded the ſaid Scriptures vnto her children as Canonical. Now then, wherefore beleeue we, or how doe we proue the Church cannot erre? I anſwere, by the reuelation of God, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in holy Scripture. If it be demaunded further, howe vve knowe ſuch a reuelation to be diuine? I anſwere, not by any other diuine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation; becauſe this is the laſt, and beleeued for it ſelfe: but by the propoſition or propounding of the Church, which is only a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requiſite for the beliefe of it; and yet a diuine proofe. So that the reaſon or cauſe why we beleeue the Church cannot erre, is the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God contained in holy Scripture: the cauſe vvhy vve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue ſuch a reuelation, is no other reuelation but it ſelfe: the meane whereby vve come to knowe that this reuelation is from God, is the propoſition of the Church: wherefore, the reſpects are diuers, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the objects of theſe aſſertions. The reſpects, becauſe when we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne the diuine reuelations contained in holy Scripture, as the reaſon of our beliefe concerning the infallible authority of the Church; we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne a reaſon (as it were) by the cauſe of our ſaid beliefe, which is diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne reuelation: But when aſſigne the propounding of the Church, as that which moueth vs to beleeue the Scripture; we aſſigne not a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by the cauſe of this our beliefe, which is diuine reuelation: but by a conditon infallibly guiding vs, as is aforeſaide. The objects alſo of theſe two reaſons yeelded of our beliefe, are diuers: For the object of the diuine reuelations contained in holy Scripture aſſigned as the reaſon of our beliefe of the Church, are the verities, or thinges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues reuealed and beleeued; but the object of the propounding or propoſition of the Church, requiſite for our beliefe of Scripture, are the reuelations themſelues contained in the ſaide Scripture: For by it we are taught that the Scripture containeth diuine reuelations, and is the true word of God. And thus much of the ſecond opinion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſolution of the queſtion propounded, which in truth gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs a very good method how to anſwere the cauils our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and rather addeth ſomething to the former, then is otherwiſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19127:62"/>
from it. For the authors following this opinion, to this that we beleeue or accept of Chriſtian faith as true, require alſo the aforeſaide inducements or arguments of credibility; but moreouer they aſſigne a diuine proofe or reaſon built vpon diuine authority, which moueth vs to the ſaide act of beliefe. For as I haue declared, they affirme that the infallible authority of the Church, which is the general propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of al particuler articles of faith, is knowne and proued by holy Scripture, as by a diuine reuelation: they adde alſo, that the truth of holy Scripture is, as certainly knowne &amp; proued by the authority of the Church, as by a diuine propounder. Neither doe I imagine, that the followers or maintainers of this opinion, doe intend to affirme, that in euery proceſſe of beliefe touching any article, it is neceſſarie that we reſolue it laſtly to the holy Scripture: for I thinke, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that which hath beene ſaid, if we be asked why we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the whole ſumme of Chriſtian doctrine, or any point thereof? we may wel anſwere, becauſe it is reuealed by God: And if further we be demaunded how infallibly and diuinely we knowe it to be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed? we may anſwere; becauſe it is propounded by the Church. Neuertheleſſe, the firſt opinion of it ſelfe is ſufficient, although this may ſeeme more exact, eſpecially in Schooles. Neither doe I or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Catholike</hi> affirme, the knowledge of theſe pointes to be necceſſary to euery faithful Chriſtian; for it is ſufficient, that they beleeue al ſuch things as are propounded by the Church, becauſe they are reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God, which is done by the helpe of ſupernatural faith. Nay I doe not think it is needful that they expreſly knowe this infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, as propounder of ſuch verities, or al ſuch pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential motiues, as are before mentioned: But I deeme it ſufficient, that they beleeue ſuch reuealed verities, as they are bound to knowe expreſly; and others virtually, moued thereunto by the authority of their predeceſſors, or the aſſeueration of other faithful people; for this is ſufficieint in them, either for the obtaining, or preſeruing the gift of ſupernatural faith. Let vs now ſee in few words, what ſolutions may be giuen to the objection made in the beginning of this Section.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therfore, according to the doctrine of the firſt opinion, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laſt reſolution of our faith; I anſwere, that in very deed the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Scriptures and their true ſenſe, are knowne by the infallible authority of the Church, as by the propounder of ſuch particuler mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters belonging to our faith and religion, as we are bound to beleeue:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19127:63"/>
Neuertheleſſe, it is lawful to proue the authority of the Church out of holy Scripture, againſt ſuch aduerſaries of the truth, as admit the ſaid authority of holy Scripture; but deny the authority of the Church. So did <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> againſt the <hi>Manichees,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. cont. epiſt. Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> voca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Fundam. ca. <hi>4.</hi> et <hi>5.</hi> Id. de vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Eccle. cap. <hi>19.</hi> et tract. <hi>13.</hi> in Ioa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nem.

Contrariwiſe, againſt the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> who allowed the Scriptures, and boaſting of their viſions rejected miracles; by Scriptures he proued the Church, and by the Church the truth of miracles: but that this manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is lawful, it is granted by <hi>Field,</hi> &amp; therfore I need ſay no more.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwere according to the other opinion, that the cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Scriptures and their true interpretation, are infallibly proued &amp; knowne by the authority of the Church, as by a condition neceſſarie propo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uding them vnto vs: but the authority of the Church is proued &amp; knowne to be infallible, by the teſtimony of holy Scriptures as by diuine reuelations approuing the ſaid authority. And to affirme this (as I haue ſhewed) is no more abſurd, then to ſay that two cauſes may be cauſes of one another. Neither doe I think this manner of proofe more to be blamed, then the proofe of a cauſe by the effect, and of the effect by the cauſe: as of fire by ſmoke, and of ſmoke by fire; of the bigneſſe &amp; proportion of a mans foote by his ſteppe in duſt or ſand, and of this againe by that. Thus alſo the Philoſophers proue a man reaſonable, becauſe he is riſible or hath power to laugh; and againe demonſtrate that he hath power to laugh, becauſe he is reaſonable: which kind of argumentation is not called circulation, but a demonſtratiue regreſſe.</p>

                  <p>THAT I may the better declare the authority and dignity of Apoſtolike vnwritten Traditions, of which I am principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to intreate in this chapter, I thinke it not amiſſe to ſay a worde or two of Apoſtolike Tradition in general: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19127:63"/>
though I ſhal repeate ſome things which haue been already ſaid; yet I hope, my reader wil pardon me, ſeing that a juſt occaſion of ſo doing is offered me. I haue aboue affirmed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2.</note> that the whole ſumme or corps of Chriſtian religion, was deliuered by Chriſt to his Apoſtles, not in writing, but by word of mouth: and that the principal meane for the entire preſeruation of it in the Church, without corruption or depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, ordained by God almighty; is the continual aſſiſtance and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the holy Ghoſt, who alwaies remaineth in the Church, and directeth her in al truth. Of which I now gather, that although neuer any ſcripture of the newe Teſtament had been written; yet, that the doctrine of Chriſt by Tradition had ſtil remained the ſelfe ſame, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and whole in the Church, to the end of the world. This is ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt out of that vvhich hath been already ſaid, that it needeth no proofe in this place: yet, I wil repeate a word or two of that, and adde a litle more to make it the more apparant. I proue it therefore, becauſe our bleſſed Sauiour neuer penned the ſumme of his doctrine himſelfe: neither is it recorded, that euer he comaunded any one of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles or Diſciples in expreſſe tearmes to write, but only to preach and teach according to his owne, and the holy Ghoſt inſtructions. And hence it is, that none of the ſaid Apoſtles or Diſciples wrote any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of the newe Teſtament, preſently after the aſcenſion of Chriſt; and conſequently, that the whole ſumme of Chriſtian doctrine was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſome time, before any ſuch ſcripture was penned, and that the Church of Chriſt was ſome yeares without it. <hi>S. Mathew</hi> the firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt,<note place="margin">Euſeb. in Chronic. anno <hi>41.</hi>
                     </note> publiſhed his Goſpel (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> recordeth) ſome ſix yeres after our Sauiours aſcenſion. Hence alſo it proceeded, that neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of the Apoſtles or Diſciples, vndertooke the ſetting downe in writing of the whole ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of Chriſtian doctrine: this is manifeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the three firſt Euangeliſts deliuered vnto vs very litle, touching the diuinity of Chriſt, one of the chiefe and higheſt miſteries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion. Neither had the fourth which was <hi>S. Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle, any intention to ſet downe al that the other three had omitted: for he wrote his Goſpel directly againſt certaine <hi>Heretikes,</hi> who denied the diuinity of Chriſt; and that not by the commandement of Chriſt, but by the intreaty of the biſhops of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as<note n="a" place="margin">Atha. in ſinopſi.</note>

Neither did he write this Goſpel at the beginning of the Church, but many yeares after, to wit: about threeſcore and ſix yeares after our Sauiours aſcenſion. And like as <hi>S.

                     <hi>Field</hi> maketh ſhewe, as though it were a plaine matter that the Euangeliſts in their Goſpels, <hi>S. Luke</hi> in the acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in the Apocalipſe, <hi>Meant to deliuer a perfect ſumme of Chriſtian doctrine, and direction of Chriſtian faith:</hi> but vvhat reaſon he bringeth for it of any moment I cannot ſee. And beſides it is certaine, that no one of them intended to ſet downe al, becauſe no one of them hath ſo done: wherfore, if they haue ſet downe al, (as he affirmeth) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it hath proceeded from ſome common deliberation or conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had among themſelues, in which they determined what euery one ſhould rehearſe; or elſe from the diſpoſition and direction of the holy Ghoſt who inſpired them to write. Not the firſt, becauſe no man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer made mention of ſuch a deliberation or conſultation, and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they wrote vpon diuers occaſions, in diuers Countries, and at diuers times, as Eccleſiaſtical hiſtories teſtifie. Not the ſecond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Field</hi> himſelfe graunteth, that ſomething is vvanting in theſe bookes which the Church beleeueth, which would not haue beene, if the holy Ghoſt had intended that al ſhould haue beene ſet downe: for he addeth, that <hi>The epiſtles of the Apoſtles were occaſionallie written; yet ſo</hi> (ſaith he:) <hi>as by the prouidence of God, al ſuch thinges as the Church beleeueth, not being found in the other parts ſcripture purpoſedly written, are moſt clearly and at large deliuered in theſe epiſtles.</hi> Marke wel (gentle reader) this doctrine: he told vs before that the Apoſtles and Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts in the Goſpels, acts of the Apoſtles and the Apocalipſe, <hi>meant to deliuer a perfect ſumme of Christian doctrine, &amp; direction of Christian faith:</hi> nowe he telleth vs, that the Church beleeueth ſome things which are deliuered in the Apoſtolical epiſtles, not being found in the other parts of ſcripture purpoſedly written. Of which I inferre, both that the holy Ghoſt intended not, that the penners of the Goſpels, of the actes of the Apoſtles, and the Apocalipſe, ſhould deliuer a perfect ſumme of Chriſtian doctrine; and alſo, that he thinketh the writers of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19127:64"/>
theſe books to haue miſſed of their intended purpoſe: verily this laſt pointe ſeemeth to me no very ſound doctrine. And beſides, how wil <hi>M. Field</hi> proue that the Apoſtles in their epiſtles ſupplied al this want? eſpecially ſeing that the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts in the other books, although intending to write al: yet in his opinion omitted ſomething, and the authours of the epiſtles intended no ſuch matter, but vvrote them (as he ſaith) <hi>occaſionally:</hi> wherefore, there is farre greater likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that theſe omitted ſomething, then they. Further, one Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical epiſtle (at the leaſt to the <hi>Laodicians</hi>) hath periſhed,<note place="margin">Coloſs. <hi>4.16.</hi> ſee <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>5, 9.</hi> Chriſoſt. hom. <hi>9.</hi> in Math. et homil. <hi>7.</hi> in <hi>1.</hi> Cor.</note> of which is mention in the epiſtle of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Coloſsians.</hi> And who can abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſay, that nothing neceſſary was contained in it, which is not in any other part of the newe Teſtament? Finally, <hi>Field</hi> himſelfe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſome vnwritten Traditions, as I will declare in the next Section.</p>
                  <p>What then did the Apoſtles and Diſciples expreſly ſet downe in thoſe their monuments, which are contained in the newe Teſtament? a part only (without al doubt) of the whole ſumme of Chriſtian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, in which part they ratified and confirmed the ſupreame and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible authority of the Church, of whome the reſt was to be learned, and to whoſe cuſtody they committed their ſaid monuments: ſo that the whole ſumme or <hi>depoſitum,</hi> hath beene kept and preſerued in the Church, not al &amp; only in expres termes in the holy ſcripture, but the whole by Tradition; &amp; a part of that whole alſo by writing, another part by only Tradition, by which likewiſe, the ſaid ſcripture it ſelfe came to our hands. And after this ſort the whole corps of Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, without any alteration deſcended vnto vs. This may be proued by that which hath been already ſaid, concerning the true ſenſe &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of holy ſcripture:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>ſect.</hi> 5.</note> for (as I haue ſhewed) the ſcripture ought to be interpreted according to the <hi>Analogie</hi> or <hi>rule of faith,</hi> that is to ſay; according to that beliefe which the Church by Tradition hath receiued from Chriſt and his Apoſtles: wherefore the letter of the holy ſcripture, is not the whole direction of the faith of the Church; but the faith of the Church, the perfect and ful direction of the ſaid letter of holy ſcripture: of which it followeth, that the faith of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church might haue remained ſound and entire by Tradition, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no ſuch letter had beene publiſhed.

                  <p>And firſt, that both ſuch Traditions are found in the Church, and that the vvhole ſumme of Chriſtian doctrine, is not expreſly contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the vvritten vvord of God, I haue already declared;<note place="margin">

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19127:66"/>
Apoſtle or Euangeliſt relateth in particular theſe diſcourſes of Chriſt. And they vvere (without al doubt) concerning the ſacraments, their adminiſtration, the gouernment of the Church, and other ſuch like affaires belonging to Chriſtian religion, which for the moſt part the Apoſtles left to their ſucceſſors; only by word of mouth and ſecret Tradition.</p>
                  <p>This in plaine termes is auouched by<note n="a" place="margin">Epiph. haereſ. <hi>61.</hi> Apoſtolico rum.</note> 
                     <hi>S.

Neither doe we finde, that euer the Apoſtles or their followers, commended and deliuered to any Church or people the ſaid newe Teſtament, as a booke comprehending in expreſſe termes, the whole ſumme of Chriſtian doctrine.

                  <p>Further, that the eſtimation of vnwritten Traditions hath euer beene exceeding great in the Church, it appeareth not only by this, that diuers of the ancient Fathers (as I haue ſhewed in the<note n="*" place="margin">

I anſwere, that although touching certaine obſeruations and ceremonies, vvhich vve affirme to be Apoſtolike, there be ſome decrees of Councels and Popes; yet, that the ſaid Councels or Popes inſtituted not ſuch obſeruations and ceremonies, but either ratified and confirmed them by their decrees, or elſe cauſed them to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued vniuerſally; whereas before, the vſe of them was not general: or finally, preſcribed to al faithful people, a certaine and vniforme manner of obſeruing them; whereas before, although the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them was general, yet they were not generally obſerued af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner in al places.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the next place I affirme, that euery man may ſecurely build his faith and religion, vpon the decrees of a lawful and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical general Councel, concerning that or thoſe matters which the Councel intendeth to define.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:19127:69"/>One principal reaſon conuincing the truth of this, may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of that, which hath beene already ſaid of the infallible autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church: for I haue proued before; not only, that it vvas neceſſary for the preſeruation of peace and vnity, that Chriſt ſhould ordaine in his Church ſome viſible, ſupreame and infallible meane, to decide controuerſies touching matters of religion: but alſo, that this prerogatiue was beſtowed by him, vpon his holy ſpouſe our mother the Church. Nowe, what Court in the world repreſenteth the whole Church, if not a general Councel; in which her viſible head either in perſon, or by his Legates, with a great part of her chiefe Paſtors and Prelates (who repreſent not only al the particuler Churches of which they haue charge, but alſo the whole body) are aſſembled? What aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly is aboue this? What decree is ſo firme and of ſuch eminent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as is the definition of ſuch a Councel? Verily, ſeeing that the authority of the Church is infallible, and ſhee doth in no ſuperiour Court pronounce her ſentence; it is manifeſt that this is the Court, in which al controuerſies touching matters of faith, with warrant of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and diuine truth, are finally decided and ended.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, if Chriſts Vicar on earth cannot erre in matters of faith, or general precepts of manners, when he teacheth the whole Church, as ſhalbe proued in the next chapter: when (if not in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councel) doth he enjoy this priueledge? If hel-gates cannot preuaile againſt the Church, vvhen (if not in a general Councel) ſhal vve thinke her ſo inuincible? If the Prelates of the Church are to be obeyed as Chriſt: When (if not in a general Councel) ſhal vve hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto them,<note place="margin">Math. <hi>18.</hi> verſe <hi>20.</hi> See before chap. <hi>6.</hi> ſection <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> and yeelde them ſuch obedience? If vvhen two or three are gathered together in the name of Chriſt, he is in the midſt of them, according to his owne promiſe; how ſhal we thinke him abſent from a general Councel? If the holie Ghoſt doth teach the Church al truth; vvhen (if not in a general Councel) doth he ſo inſtruct and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect her? Finally, if the Biſhops &amp; Prelates of the Church in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councel may erre themſelues, how can they (as vve are taught by the Apoſtle they ſhould) according to the ordination of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Epheſ. <hi>4.</hi> verſ. <hi>11.</hi> &amp;c.</note> keepe al the whole Church from <hi>wauering</hi> and errour in faith?</p>
               <p>Hence the deciſion of a general Councel, hath euer had three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal prerogatiues giuen it, by al allowed monuments of antiquity; which may alſo manifeſtly be deduced out of holy ſcripture it ſelfe. Firſt, that it is (as is aforeſaid) the ſupreame and laſt judicial ſentence
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19127:69"/>
of the Church, from which there can be no appeale, and vvhich by no meanes can be made void or recalled. This we gather out of<note n="a" place="margin">Atha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. ad E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pictetum.</note>

               <p>Vnto this I adde, that al Chriſtian <hi>Catholike</hi> Emperors by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, adjudged ſuch as <hi>Heretikes;</hi> and made them ſubject to the

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, by the ſame Councels and Fathers, the decrees of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councels are ſaid to be diuine, and from the holy Ghoſt; of which it followeth, that they are of infallible truth and not ſubject to errour.

truth by the holy Ghoſt: vnto which I joine this taken out of the Acts of the Apoſtles, to wit: that the Apoſtles and auncients aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the firſt Councel held at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> in their deciſion of the matter then in controuerſie, vſed this ſtile:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>It hath ſeemed good to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt and vs,</hi> &amp;c. giuing vs to vnderſtand, that in holy Councels the reſolution of controuerſies and other decrees, proceede jointely from the holy Ghoſt, and the Fathers aſſembled; and that he toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vvith them, propoundeth vnto vs ſuch thinges as are decreed. And becauſe al general Councels euer ſince, haue had the ſame dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt; they haue likewiſe euer vſed the ſame kind of ſtile.</p>
               <p>Of the authority of the decrees of the ſaid firſt Councel, held by the Apoſtles at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> we are ſufficiently informed in the ſaid hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Actes of the Apoſtles: In which <hi>S. Luke</hi> recordeth,<note place="margin">

And hither alſo tend the diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of thoſe <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who (as I haue aboue related) make the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Church diuine.</p>
               <p>But it may (perhaps) be anſwered by ſome man, to theſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of our aduerſaries; that notwithſtanding al theſe their aſſertions, they make general Councels abſolutely ſubject to errour. I anſwere and confeſſe, that in very deede they doe ſo; yet I affirme, that any wiſe and diſcreete man, may wel gather out of their ſayinges alleaged, not only that general Councels are needful in the Church, and that al their deuiſion and diſſention, proceedeth of their denial of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſuch Councels: But alſo that it was requiſite and neceſſary, that Chriſt who is <hi>neuer wanting to his Church in thinges needful,</hi> ſhould make the authority of general Councels concerning matters of faith, infallible. For otherwiſe, if they were ſubject to errour, what reaſon hath man to obey them in matters of ſuch conſequence? eſpecially conſidering, that diuers ſuch aſſemblies vnlaweful, conſiſting of a greater multitude of Biſhoppes, then ſome lawful general Councels, haue erred and ſtraied from the truth. Finally they confeſſe, that the firſt ſuch Councels aſſembled in the firſt ages of Chriſtianity, erred not: And thus much for the proofe of this matter.</p>
               <p>It may (perhaps) be here further demaunded, what conditions we require to a lawful and authentical general Councel? I anſwere brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly; firſt, that ſuch a Councel muſt either be called expreſly, by the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19127:72"/>
miniſterial head of the Church, or (at the leaſt) with his aſſent. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſummon muſt be general, of al Biſhops throughout the world. Thirdly, although it be not needeful that al be perſonallie and reallie preſent: yet, a competent number muſt appeare, that is to ſay; ſome (at the leaſt) out of the greater part of Chriſtian <hi>Catholike</hi> prouinces: yet, if it be aſſembled in the Eaſt, a ſmal number of the Weſt ſent to ſupply the place of al the reſt, are judged to ſuffice: Contrariwiſe, if in the Weſt, a ſmal number in ſuch ſort is ſufficient out of the Eaſt. Fourthly, the miniſterial head or vicegerent of Chriſt, muſt either be preſent in perſon, or by his Legates. And finally, the decrees of the ſaid Councel, muſt be by him confirmed: and this, both becauſe the head is chiefe ruler of the body; and conſequently, the body is to doe nothing without the aſſent of the head; and alſo, becauſe he hath ſinguler priuileges granted him by Chriſt of not erring, as ſhal be declared in the next chapter. Hence it proceedeth, that no gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councel hath euer in the Church beene held Canonical, without his approbation, although the number of Biſhoppes vvere neuer ſo great, as appeareth by that of <hi>Epheſus</hi> vnder <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger: by that of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> vnder <hi>Leo Iſaurus,</hi> and diuers others. And out of this diſcourſe I gather, that this authority of general Councels if we had no other argument, were ſufficient to perſwade vs, to deteſt and abhorre the condemned doctrine of the new Sectaries. For the ſame Church which in the firſt general Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ius</hi> and the <hi>Arians:</hi> the ſame, which in the ſecond ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel held at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> condemned <hi>Macedonius</hi> and the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> vvhich in the third held at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> condemned <hi>Neſtorius</hi> &amp; the <hi>Neſtorians;</hi> vvhich in the fourth held at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> condemned <hi>Euti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> and the <hi>Eutichians;</hi> vvhich finally, in other general Councels, hath condemned other <hi>Heretiks</hi> and hereſies: The ſelfe ſame Church (I ſay) directed in al truth by the holy Ghoſt, hath condemned and accurſed <hi>Luther</hi> and the <hi>Lutherans, Zuinglius</hi> and the <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> vvith al their followers togeather vvith their doctrine, in the laſt general Councel held at <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they ſay that this Councel vvas not laweful, nor the judges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. I reply, firſt; that this hath beene an old cauil of al con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Heretiks:</hi> wherefore, it may lawefully be ſuſpected in theſe. Moreouer, it is ſufficiently proued by <hi>Catholike</hi> authors, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is euident in it ſelfe, that nothing neceſſarie to a laweful general
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19127:73"/>
Councel, vvas vvanting in this: vvherefore, it is receiued by the vvhole Church, as <hi>Canonical;</hi> and therefore no vviſe man (ſeing that ſaluation and damnation vpon this depend) vvil reject it vpon theſe mens reportes.</p>
               <p>They affirme further, that the Church hath no authority in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councel, to make any newe article of faith. To this likewiſe I anſwere, that the Church properly maketh no newe article of faith: for euerie decree by her made concerning ſuch matters, is either in expreſſe tearmes contained in the holie ſcriptures: or gathered out of them by infallible deduction, through the direction of the holie Ghoſt; or expreſly or virtually approued by the vnwritten Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church: wherefore, the Church neither hath euer taught or ſhal euer teach any truth ſo newe, that it vvas vnknowne to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. For that which by her is defined and propounded, was true before; and an article of faith, although ſometimes not certainelie nor generally knowne before, to be of ſuch authority or dignity. And that this is our doctrine it is graunted by <hi>Field,</hi> vvhoſe vvords are theſe:<note place="margin">Field book <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>12.</hi> § Our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries.</note>

We hold therefore, that the ſupreame power which our Sauiour Chriſt euen according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, receiued of his Father before his aſcention ouer al his Church (of which are theſe his wordes.<note place="margin">

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, becauſe he vvas to withdrawe his viſible corporal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from the Church millitant, and therefore could not himſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,

and giues ſentence or aduiſe in matters doubtful: like as Kinges or Princes not being reſident in their dominions, for the good and peaceable gouernment of their ſubjects, appoint Viceroies or Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents:<note place="margin">

Peter,</hi> who immediately receiued ſuch juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and authority from him; and therefore during his mortal life, was his Vicegerent on earth, miniſterial head of his Church, and chiefe gouernour, Paſtour, and Prelate of the ſame. And hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the firſt difference betweene Chriſt and <hi>S. Peter,</hi> touching the ſupremacie ouer the Church. For although they be both termed ſupreame heads of the ſame; yet the laſt of them, is ſubordinate &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth of the firſt: and the firſt only is the ſupreame independent, the laſt was the ſupreame viſible, miniſterial &amp; dependent head. Of which it appeareth, that the authority and juriſdiction of the ſecond, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing prejudicial to that of the firſt: for they may ſtand very wel toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſeing that the one was ſubordinate to the other. Neither doe Chriſt and his vicar properly make two heads of the Church, but one: like as a King and his viceroy make not properly two Kings, but one. For like as the King notwithſtanding his viceroy, is the one chiefe prince, gouernour, and head of his country: ſo is Chriſt the chiefe Prelate and head of his Church. <hi>S. Peter</hi> vvas his vicar and vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: and ſo is at this preſent his ſucceſſour the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> For the proofe of the truth of this doctrine it maketh, that like as Chriſt in the holy ſcripture is called <hi>Head of the Church:</hi> ſo he is likewiſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<note n="a" place="margin">

S.</hi> Peter (ſaith he) <hi>be a rocke, yet he is not a rocke as Chriſt is: for Chriſt is the true immoueable rocke of himſelfe:</hi> Peter <hi>is immoueable through Chriſt the rocke. For Ieſus doth impart and communicate his dignities, not voiding himſelfe of them: but holding them to himſelfe, he beſtoweth them alſo vpon others. He is the light, and yet you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are the light. He is the Prieſt, and yet he maketh Prieſts. He is a Rocke, and yet be maketh a Rocke:</hi> thus farre <hi>S. Baſil.</hi> The like diſcourſe vve finde in <hi>S. Leo:</hi> for expounding thoſe vvordes of our Sauiour, <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter; thus he ſpeaketh in the perſon of Chriſt to the ſaid Apoſtle. <hi>Whereas I am an inuiolable Rocke;</hi> I <hi>the corner ſtone, who make both one; I the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beſides which no man can lay another: yet thou alſo art a rocke, becauſe by my power thou art made firme and ſtrong, to the end that thoſe thinges which are proper to me by power, be made common to thee by participation:</hi> hitherto <hi>S. Leo.</hi> And thus much of the firſt difference betweene Chriſt and <hi>S. Peter,</hi> touching their ſuperiority ouer the Church.</p>
                  <p>An other difference betweene them is, that the authority of Chriſt vvas euer abſolute; of <hi>S. Peter</hi> limited: for our Sauiour deriued not vnto him al his authoritie, but a part onlie of the ſame. Hence it proceedeth, that although Chriſt inſtituted ſacraments, forgaue ſins vvithout the vſe of anie ſacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet, neither <hi>S. Peter</hi> nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his ſucceſſours, euer had anie ſuch power or authority: The reaſon is, becauſe euery man but Chriſt, hath alwaies beene bound to vſe the meanes by him inſtituted, and left vnto his Church. Of vvhich it appeareth, howe falſe their ſlaunder is, vvho affirme the Pope to pardon ſinnes by his Indulgences or Pardons: for certaine it is, that by ſuch indulgences no ſinnes are forgiuen, but men are onlie releaſed of ſuch temporal paine, as is due vnto them. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo confeſſed by al <hi>Catholikes,</hi> that no man (as long as he is guilty of mortal ſinne, and out of the ſtate of grace) can receiue anie benefite from any ſuch pardon.</p>
                  <p>A third difference is, that our Sauiour being the way, the truth, and life; yea, the ſonne of God himſelfe, could neither erre in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor in manners, that is: he could neither haue any falſe or erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous opinion, in his vnderſtanding; nor ſinne or erre from reaſon and right, in his wil and actions: Contrariewiſe, his vicar (although as I vvil proue hereafter) vvhen he teacheth the whole Church as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Paſtor, cannot erre in matters of faith or precepts of manners, vvhich he preſcribeth to al faithful Chriſtians and concerne thinges
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19127:76"/>
neceſſary to ſaluation; or in thoſe things which are of themſelues good or euil (for he cannot ſo commaund anie vice, or forbid any vertue) yet, as a priuate man or particuler doctour, he may erre in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or opinion: he may alſo offend God moſt deepely and be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in hel-fire.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. <hi>verſe</hi> 48.</note> 
                     <hi>For if that ſeruant whome his Lord hath appointed ouer his family,</hi> (theſe are our Sauiours words) <hi>ſhal ſay in his hart my Lord is long a comming, and ſhal beginne to ſtrike his fellowe ſeruantes, and eateth and drinketh with drunckards; the Lord of that ſeruant ſhal come in a day that he hopeth not, and an houre that he knoweth not, and ſhal diuide him, and appoint his portion with the hipocrites: there ſhalbe weeping and gnaſhing of teeth:</hi> Thus our Sauiour Chriſt. But although <hi>S. Peter</hi> in authority and diuers other prerogatiues, was farre inferiour to Chriſt, euen as man: yet, he vvas ſuperiour to al the reſt of the Apoſtles. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though al the Apoſtles receiued of Chriſt, orders and power to vſe the keies of the kingedome of heauen (that is, to forgiue ſinnes) and alſo to preach the Goſpel throughout the whole world: yet <hi>S. Peter</hi> only aboue the reſt receiued ſupreame power, authority, and juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The authority of the other Apoſtles was giuen them with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinde of ſubjection to <hi>Peter:</hi> they were alſo Chriſtes legates or embaſſadours ſent to the whole world; but they being only Apoſtles were equal among themſelues, and no one ſuperiour ouer the other. Neither were they ordinary Biſhops or Paſtours of the whole world; for of it <hi>S. Peter</hi> vvas only the ordinary Paſtour. Wherefore, like as a legate or embaſſadour, cannot of himſelfe communicate or delegate his authority to another, or leaue it by inheritance to his ſucceſſour: ſo the other Apoſtles left not al their authority in ſo ample ſort as they receiued it, to the Biſhoppes vvho ſucceeded them: contrariwiſe, <hi>S. Peter</hi> as abſolute prince, hauing abſolute and ordinarie juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnder Chriſt, left the ſame to his ſucceſſour or heire the Biſhoppe of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This doctrine vve receiue from the holie father and martir <hi>S. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> vvho of this point diſcourſeth thus.<note place="margin">Cipr. lib. de vnitate Eccleſiae cap. <hi>3.</hi>

Peter</hi> had ſupreame and ordinary authority: the other Apoſtles although they had equal and like Apoſtolike power; yet they were not equal to him in al prerogatiues: this their authority (as I haue ſaid) was not ordinary nor ſo abſolute, but depending &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his beginning of that of <hi>Peter.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. ca <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> Hence the ſame <hi>S.

                  <p>But vvhen did Chriſt performe theſe promiſes? Verilie no man (I thinke) vvil be ſo vvicked and blaſpheamous as to ſaie, that our Redeemer vvas not ſo good as his vvord: vvhen then vvere theſe promiſes performed? In verie truth after our Lordes reſurrection; when as he made this bleſſed Apoſtle general Paſtor ouer al his flock, exempting none, no not the other Apoſtles themſelues, from his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction; but committing al both ſheepe, and lambs to his charge: for he ſaid to him,<note n="n" place="margin">

                     <hi>Feed my lambes, feed my ſheepe.</hi> And verilie it is apparant that by theſe vvordes, ſupreame authoritie vnder Chriſt,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19127:79"/>
was giuen to this Apoſtle, ouer al the flocke and Church of Chriſt. For vvhat other meaning can they admit? Euerie man vvil confeſſe that it is the part of him that feedeth ſheepe, to prouide them foode, which belongeth to a ſuperior &amp; gouernor. What other thing is it to feede, guide, defend, rule, correct, then to be ſuperior ouer his flocke? And this alſo the <hi>Greek</hi> word vſed by the Euangeliſt in this place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth; vvhich ſignifieth to feede, by ruling and being ſuperiour. Moreouer, who can deny but thoſe wordes <hi>(My lambs, and my ſheepe)</hi> comprehend al Chriſtians? For the <hi>Lambes</hi> are the laie ſort of people, and ſuch as are not ſpiritual Paſtors ouer other; the <hi>Sheepe</hi> are the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes and Paſtours of the Church, who bring forth vnto Chriſt <hi>lambs.</hi> Adde alſo, that al the lambs and ſheepe of Chriſt, without any limitation or reſtriction, vvere here committed to <hi>S. Peters</hi> charge: wherefore, no man could exempt himſelfe from his juriſdiction, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he would deny himſelfe to be a ſheepe or lambe of Chriſt. And this may be confirmed by thoſe wordes of our Redeemer: <hi>I knowe my ſheepe;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1, 14.</note> 
                     <hi>my ſheepe heare my voice; I yeeld my life for my ſheepe.</hi> For like as in theſe places, the word <hi>(ſheepe)</hi> ſignifieth al Chriſtians; ſo it muſt needs doe in thoſe words; <hi>feed my lambes, feed my ſheepe.</hi> I conclude therefore, that in theſe words, al the members or children of Chriſts Church, were committed to <hi>S. Peters</hi> charge; and that he was made Paſtour of the whole fold and flocke of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But let vs confirme al this by the teſtimony of the auncient Fathers: <hi>S. Leo</hi> of this matter diſcourſeth thus.<note place="margin">Leo ſerm. <hi>3.</hi> de Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt. ſua.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Another argument alſo out of the holy ſcripture for confirmation of the ſame, may be gathered of this; that <hi>S. Peter</hi> in the ſaid ſcripture, is not onlie called the firſt of the Apoſtles: but alſo among the reſt when they are named, obtaineth the firſt place. He is called the firſt by<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>S. Mathew,</hi> according as we read in al <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> copies. The wordes of the Euangeliſt are theſe: <hi>And the names of the twelue Apoſtles be theſe, the firſt,</hi> Simon <hi>who is called</hi> Peter.

                  <p>Moreouer, it is a thing moſt certaine and confeſſed by al Chriſtians, that the old teſtament was a figure of the newe, and that the Church of Chriſt ſucceedeth in the true ſeruice of God, the ſinagogue of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> now, that in the old lawe there was alwaies one high prieſt, no man reading the old teſtament can denie, and it is confeſſed by our aduerſaries themſelues, eſpecially by the<note n="a" place="margin">Magde. centur. <hi>1.</hi> lib. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi> col. <hi>157.</hi>

                     <hi>Magdeburgenſes,</hi> and <hi>Caluin:</hi> of whome the firſt write thus. <hi>In the Church of the people of the</hi> Iewes, <hi>there was one only high or chiefe prieſt by the diuine law, whom al were forced to acknowledge &amp; obey.</hi>

                     <hi>S. Ciprian: He that withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and reſiſteth the Church; he that forſaketh</hi> Peters <hi>Chaire, vpon which the Church was built, doth he truſt that he is in the Church?</hi> Further, like
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19127:80"/>
as the true Church being among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> the high Prieſt by the commandement of God, had his ſeate and principal reſidence in <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> their chiefe citty: ſo the truth being taken away from the <hi>Iewes</hi> and deliuered to the <hi>Gentils,</hi> it was conuenient that the See of the high Prieſt, ſhould be placed in <hi>Rome,</hi> the principal cittie of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reaſon alſo proueth, that there ought to be one ſupreame viſible gouernour in the Church.

Out of which ground I frame this argument: Chriſt without al doubt ordained a meane for the preſeruation of vnity in his Church; but v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity cannot be preſerued in it without one viſible head hauing juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ouer it al: therefore, Chriſt ordained one ſuch viſible head. And this one head was during the time of his life, the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>S.

This reaſon (as we haue heard <hi>Caluin</hi> before confeſſe) was that which moued God in the old lawe <hi>to appoint one Prelate aboue the reſt:</hi> And for the ſuperiority of one in the newe law, it was long ſince aſſigned by<note n="*" place="margin">Hieron. aduerſus Iouinianu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                     <hi>S.

and ſchiſmes riſe in the Church of no other cauſe, then that the Prieſt of God is not obeyed, and that one Prieſt and judg in Chriſtes place is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged.</hi> In another epiſtle he hath this ſentence:<note n="a" place="margin">Cip. epi. <hi>4.</hi> ſee him alſo de vni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ta.

                     <hi>God is one, and Chriſt is one; and the Church is one, and the Chaire is one, by our Lords voice founded on</hi> Peter. <hi>There can no other altare be erected, or newe Prieſthood be made, beſides the one altare and one Prieſthood: whoſoeuer doth elſ-where gather, doth diſperſe.</hi> And is it not apparant (except there be ſome one ſuperiour that may keepe vnitie and vniformitie, whome al the reſt ought to obey) that ſciſme, diuiſion, and rebellion wil preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enſue? wil not euery one beleeue, doe, and change as he pleaſeth? wil one conforme himſelfe to another? certainly he wil not: of which vvil followe as many diſtinct faithes and religions, as there be heads and fancies.

But theſe may likewiſe eaſily be confuted: for it is euident euen by the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that no good can be done by ſuch a Councel, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one head and ſuperiour in the ſame be granted. About the yeare of our Lord 1585. <hi>Henry</hi> nowe the <hi>French</hi> king and a <hi>Catholike,</hi> then king of <hi>Nauar</hi> and a <hi>Caluiniſt,</hi> ſent his letters to certaine Electours and princes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, being <hi>Lutheran Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> deſiring a concord and reconciliation, betweene the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Sacramentaries,</hi> and wiſhing (as it ſhould ſeeme by the anſwere) that ſome Councel might be aſſembled of the learned men of both ſortes, to that purpoſe. The ſaid <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> returned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that in thoſe daies thinges ſtanding as they did, they thought it not neceſſary that ſuch a courſe ſhould be taken touching a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel: and vvhy ſo? Verily, theſe reaſons are by them alleaged. <hi>This principally</hi> (ſay they) <hi>ſeemeth worthy of our conſideration, whether now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the diuines of other Churches and ours, any Sinode can be called and aſsembled. For who of vs wil arrogate to himſelfe, to appoint the place, to name the day, to cal the diuines of diuers nations? Which (as hiſtories teſtifie) was the proper office of the</hi> Romane <hi>Emperours, before the Papal tirannie increaſed. Nowe moreouer, who ſhal haue rule or be ſuperior in authority in the Sinode it ſelfe? There can no other haue this office, but either one of our ſide or of our aduerſaries: but neither we wil ſuffer a preſident or chiefe ruler of the aduerſe part, to the prejudice of ours: ſo neither wil they (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt) endure, that one of ours ſhould haue that place. But if of both ſides ſome be appointed, then each one wil vndertake the patronage of his owne part, and ſo there wil ariſe diſſention betweene the Preſidents. Further, who ſhalbe judge ouer thoſe that varie or contend? but let vs put the caſe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faine and imagine that the Sinod is now called; that it is ſufficiently argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on both ſides; that the Preſidents haue pronounced their ſentence; that the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19127:82"/>
pertinacious and fanatical are condemned and accurſed, by the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and ſuffrage of al: Who then ſhal bridle and reſtraine the clamours of the condemned? their complaints? their accuſations? by which they wil exclaime that the proceedings againſt them haue been vnjuſt; that they were not rightly heard; that judgement was giuen rather according to affection, then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word of God. Hence wil ariſe newe ſwarmes of contentions, and the Sinode being ended, the Church wil enjoy no more quietnes, tranquillity and peace, then was before.</hi> Thus the aforeſaid Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> in their letter penned (without al doubt, or at the leaſt viewed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued) by their beſt diuines. The Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Brandeburg,</hi> the Adminiſtrator of <hi>Magdeburge, Philip Lewes Palatine</hi> of <hi>Rhene, Iulius</hi> Duke of <hi>Brunſwich</hi> and <hi>Luneberg, Vdalricus</hi> Duke of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelburg,</hi> and <hi>Lewes</hi> Duke of <hi>Wittenberge</hi> ſubſcribed vnto it.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19127:82"/>
by any councel held among them. But vnto the <hi>Lutherans</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue cited, I adde alſo the authority of <hi>Whitakers;</hi> who graunteth,<note place="margin">Whitaker li. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilijs p. <hi>56.</hi>
                     </note> that <hi>without authority no Councel can be aſsembled:</hi> And ſeeing that no one (according to <hi>Proteſtants</hi>) hath authority ouer the whole world, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth; that in their judgement no Councel can be aſſembled of al the Prelates of the world. And out of this doctrine of our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, joined vnto that maintained by diuers of them, concerning the neceſſity of general Councels, vvhich is likewiſe ſtrongly by me pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before, I inferre; that it was neceſſarie that God ſhould appoint ſome one general viſible head ouer his Church: which illation is very euident: For if general Councels be neceſſary, and they cannot be had without a head, it muſt needs followe; that Chriſt who <hi>is not wanting to his Church in thinges neceſſarie,</hi> ordained ſome ſuch head.<note place="margin">Andraeas Fricius de Eccleſia l. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>10.</hi> pag. <hi>570.</hi>
                     </note> Hence <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draeas Fricius</hi> although a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and a man bearing deadlie hatred to the Biſhoppe of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet thought it needful, that one head ſhould be appointed ouer al the euangellical Churches, to keepe them in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which he deemed otherwiſe would neuer be: and handling that matter, he alſo truly anſwereth that common objection of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> touching the title of vniuerſal Biſhoppe, out of <hi>S. Gregorie;</hi> of which before. But the <hi>Lutherans</hi> (as vve haue ſeene) auerre, that it vvas in times paſt the proper office of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, to cal general Councels. I reply; firſt, it is euident that Chriſt bequeathed not this office to the Emperor, both becauſe the office being neceſſarie in the Church, Chriſt (if he had ſo done) ſhould haue taken order, that euer there ſhould haue bin ſome one Emperor ouer the whole world, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the ſame; which (as is euident) he did not: And alſo, becauſe many of the Emperors haue beene <hi>Infidels,</hi> ſome <hi>Heretiks,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in al reaſon not capable of any ſuch preheminence in the Church. Secondly, it is very wel proued by <hi>Catholike</hi> authors, that there neuer hath beene any one lawful general Councel aſſembled in the Church, by the Emperour alone, without the conſent and authority of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe of <hi>Rome:</hi> which I confirme only in this place, by an <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical canon</hi> alleaged by <hi>Socrates;</hi> which (as he ſaith) <hi>forbiddeth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Socrates lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>13.</hi>

                     <hi>that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees be made in the Church without the conſent of the Biſhoppe of</hi> Rome. And ſeing that this canon was not made by any Councel, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that it deſcended from the Apoſtles themſelues: But of this point enough.</p>

Neither is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny auncient authour, that euer called the matter in queſtion as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the monuments themſelues of <hi>Rome</hi> moſt euidently conuince our aſſertion to be true: yea, it is gathered out of <hi>S.

But certaine it is, that the vertue of Chriſts promiſe made to this bleſſed Apoſtle, together with his office deſcended to al the Biſhoppes of <hi>Rome</hi> his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours. This I haue partly proued in the ſecond ſection of the ſixt chapter before, vvhere I haue declared, that the promiſes made by Chriſt to his Apoſtles, concerning the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt in the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were to be verified in the Biſhoppes of the Church, during al ages enſuing. In this place I wil only repeate, that no man of ſenſe wil imagine, that Chriſt building his Church <hi>for euer,</hi> proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Paſtours and Apoſtolike officers onlie for it, during the life of <hi>S.

                     <hi>SECTION THE THIRD.</hi> That the decrees of the Biſhop of Rome, when he teacheth the Church as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Paſtour, are of diuine and infallible authority; and of ſome other groundes of faith, flowing out of theſe.</head>
                  <p>HAVING already proued, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is the true ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and miniſterial head of Chriſts Church; it remaineth that now we ſee, what authority and credit is to be giuen to his decrees. I affirme therefore, that the Pope when (teaching the vvhole Church as miniſterial head of the ſame) he defineth anie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning faith, and general preceptes of vice or vertue, cannot erre: I adde thoſe vvords, <hi>when teaching the whole Church as miniſterial head</hi> &amp;c. becauſe vve confeſſe that the Pope may ſinne and erre in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, vnderſtanding, and priuate doctrine; and we defend only, that his judicial ſentence pronounced as he is Pope, concerning matters of faith and precepts of manners, cannot be falſe or erronious. And this is euident, firſt by the teſtimony of Chriſt himſelfe, who vnto <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> the Apoſtle vſed theſe words: <hi>Simon</hi> Simon,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 31.32.</note> 
                     <hi>behold Satan required to haue you to ſift as wheate, but I haue praied for thee that thy faith faile not, and thou once conuerted, confirme thy brethren.</hi> Marke vvel thoſe words: <hi>Satan hath required to haue you, but I haue praied for thee,</hi> which argue a ſinguler priuiledge in S. <hi>Peter,</hi> of not erring in faith, aboue the reſt of the Apoſtles. For ſathan required to ſift them al, and our Lord praied for <hi>Peter</hi> only, that his faith might not be ouerthrowne by anie ſubtil deceits, open aſſaults or other practiſes of the diuel. The like is inſinuated by thoſe words following: <hi>And thou once conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, confirme thy bretheren:</hi> which both proue, that the firſt part of the ſentence was proper to <hi>S. Peter</hi> only (I meane that his faith <hi>ſhould not faile</hi>) and alſo declare, that the reſt of the Apoſtles, were by him to be confirmed and ſtrengthened in their beliefe. Hence proceedeth this ſentence of <hi>S. Leo: The danger was common to al the Apoſtles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Leo ſerm. <hi>3.</hi> de aſsu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p ſua.</note> 
                     <hi>but our Lord took ſpecial care of</hi> Peter, <hi>that the ſtate of al the reſt might be more ſure, if the head were inuincible: God ſo diſpoſing the aide of his grace, that the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſtrength which Chriſt gaue to</hi> Peter, <hi>might redound by</hi> Peter <hi>to the

rest of the Apoſtles:</hi> Hitherto <hi>S. Leo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſignifie this priuiledg of <hi>S. Peter</hi> to vs, our Sauiour chaunged (as I haue before declared) his name from <hi>Simon</hi> to <hi>Cephas</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> both vvhich wordes ſignifie a rock: <hi>Thou art</hi> Simon (ſaid he) <hi>the ſonne of</hi> Iona, <hi>thou ſhalt be called</hi> Cephas, <hi>which is interpreted</hi> Peter or a rock. For howe wel doe theſe two ſentences anſwere one another; <hi>Thy faith ſhal not faile,</hi> and <hi>Thou art a rock.</hi> And vpon this rock afterwards he built his Church, vvarranting it from euer being ouercome by the deuil or his miniſters,<note place="margin">Mat. <hi>16.</hi> verſe <hi>18.</hi> Iohn <hi>21.</hi> v. <hi>17.18.</hi> Ambroſe in himnis. Auguſt. li. <hi>1.</hi> retrac. cap. <hi>21.</hi>
                     </note> which he promiſed to doe (as I haue aboue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) in theſe his wordes to this B. Apoſtle: <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter <hi>or a rock, and vpon this rock I wil build my Church, and the gates of hel ſhal not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againſt it;</hi> and performed in thoſe: <hi>Feed my lambes: feed my ſheepe.</hi> Hence by <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> (as <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> recordeth) <hi>S. Peter</hi> is called the <hi>Rock of the Church,</hi> that is: the very ſtrength and foundation of it next vnto Chriſt. Neither did our Sauiour without juſt cauſe, grant this extraordinary priuiledg vnto him: for he (as I haue alſo before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) for the preſeruation of vnity, and better direction of his ſpouſe, vvas appointed by him Paſtour of the whole Church, ſheepheard of his whole flock, his chiefe vicar and miniſterial head of his body. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his charge he committed both his ſheep and lambs, exempting no Chriſtians from his juriſdiction: wherefore it was neceſſary, that he ſhould be ſo directed concerning matters of faith and religion, ſeing that the members are to obey the head, and ſheepe to followe and to be guided by their Shepheard, that he ſhould not drawe them into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, or propound vnto them any bad paſture of falſe doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Like as therefore God alwaies in the old lawe, preſerued the truth in the Chaire of <hi>Moiſes,</hi> wherefore (as I haue ſhewed before) al men vvere bound vnder paine of death, to obey the high Prieſt; and our Sauiour ſaid:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 23. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2.</note> 
                     <hi>vpon the Chaire of</hi> Moiſes <hi>haue ſitten the ſcribes &amp; phariſies; al things therefore whatſoeuer they ſhal ſay vnto you, obſerue ye and doe ye:</hi> ſo acording to the aſſertion of <hi>S.

                  <p>I adde alſo, that this vvas neceſſary for the condemnation of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; becauſe, although the ſentence of a general Councel pronounced againſt any hereſie, cannot be erronious; yet euery man wil graunt, that ſuch a Councel ſometimes by reaſon of perſecution or other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19127:85"/>
can not be aſſembled: yea euery man muſt needes confeſſe, that at no time ſuch a Councel can be ſo ſoone gathered, as it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſary that an hereſie ſpringing vp ſhould be condemned.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Finallie, in a general Councel it ſelfe, it is not onlie needeful that there be one ſupreame judge: but alſo that the ſentence of this judge at the leaſt, joined with the cenſure and approbation of a part of the Councel, be of an infallible truth and of diuine authority. The firſt part of this aſſertion is proued before, and is euident; becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we muſt needs confeſſe, that no certaine meane is ordained in the Church to end controuerſies: For the Prelates aſſembled in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel being diuided, either part might refuſe to ſtand to the others judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſecond alſo is euen as apparant, becauſe otherwiſe we haue no certaine rule, whereby in ſuch a diuiſion to know which part hath the truth.

Wherefore, if we ſhould yeeld this preheminence to the greater part, that it muſt be obeied; hereſies and falſe doctrine might be eſtabliſhed in a Councel, without any meanes left vs to knowe, when it doth erre, and when it defineth a truth; to which I likewiſe adde, that it may fal

out that both parts be equal: And laſtlie, that we haue no warrant in holie ſcripture, that the one part ſhal haue infallible directions by Gods ſpirit, more then the other. And ſeing that we haue the moſt manifeſt authority of the ſaid ſcripture, warranting vs that the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſuor of <hi>S.

There came to my handes of late, a litle pamphlet bearing this title. <hi>A Chriſtian and modeſt offer of a moſt indifferent conference or diſputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the many and principal controuerſies betwixt the Prelates,</hi>

                     <hi>and continue perſwaded ſtil, that the truth is on their ſide, it were impious for either ſide in ſuch a caſe, to commit the abſolute determination therof, vnto the wil and pleaſure of any man or men whatſoeuer.</hi> They adde; that <hi>it were vnjuſt for either ſide, to require judges either incompetent, or not indifferent.</hi> And their reaſon is; becauſe <hi>as the prelates (except they would wilfully betray their owne cauſe) might juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſe ſuch to be judges, as haue in any degree inclined more to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters then to them; ſo may the miniſters in like manner as justly refuſe, to ſtand to the judgement and determination of ſuch, as incline more to the Prelates then to them:</hi> thus they.

This is the ſubſtance of their anſwere to the aforeſaid objection. And vvhat prudent man reading theſe thinges, wil not firſt judge, that this courſe is no ſufficient meane to decide matters in queſtion; then, that one ſupreame judge whoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is of infallible truth, is neceſſary for the final ending of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions? Who wil not likewiſe inferre, that Chriſt <hi>who is not wanting to his Church in thinges neceſsarie,</hi> hath ordained ſome ſuch ſupreame judge? And like as the <hi>Puritanes</hi> proceed after this ſort, ſo might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the Biſhops, if it ſhould happen they ſhould be diuided among them ſelues, touching any point of religion. But although theſe thinges be ſo; yet we hold not the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> can raſhly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine what he pleaſe, for he is bound to proceed maturely, and to vſe ſuch inquiſition, arguments, aduiſe of learned men and other meanes, as are neceſſary for the finding out of the truth of the matter, which he is to define. Neither can he inſtitute any ſacrament, or make any new article of faith, vnknowne altogither to the Apoſtles, or not deliuered by them to the Church, as I haue ſaid before of a general Councel.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.</note> Only touching theſe points, he hath power more plainly and expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlie to explicate to the faithful thoſe verities, which the ſaid Apoſtles either knew or deliuered, and to bring them (as it were) from darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to light.</p>
                  <p>Some men perhaps wil admit, that <hi>S. Peter</hi> had a prerogatiue of not erring in faith, but wil deny that it was euer deriued to his ſucceſſors. This euaſion is fullie aboue confuted: yet here I adde further,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2.</note> that this vvarrant from errour in faith, was more neceſſarie after <hi>S. Peters</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of the world in his ſucceſſours, then before in himſelfe; both becauſe the chiefeſt planters and rulers of the Church the holie Apoſtles and Diſciples, were then likewiſe, or ſoone after deceaſed; and alſo becauſe perſecution daily increaſed, and new hereſies in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abundance began to impugne the rule of faith receiued. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, our Sauiour building his Church vpon <hi>S. Peter,</hi> built it eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vpon his faith (not vpon his fleſh, as ſome of the auncient Fathers
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19127:87"/>
ſay) neither ſo vpon his faith, that he built it vpon faith ſeparated from <hi>S. Peter,</hi> or being in any other perſon: but vpon faith as being in <hi>S. Peter</hi> the miniſterial head of the Church. Wherefore, although the fleſh of <hi>S. Peter</hi> be conſumed, yet ſeing that his office and dignity is in his ſucceſſours, his faith alſo through the warrant of Chriſt ſtil remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in them, vvhich is the foundation of the Church, and the firme <hi>rocke,</hi> againſt which <hi>Hel-gates ſhal not preuaile.</hi> And this may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, becauſe Chriſt vvhen he praied for the faith of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and imparted this prerogatiue vnto him, as his ſupreame vicar, or by reaſon of his office: Wherefore, ſeing that the office continueth alwaies in the Church, the priuiledg likewiſe muſt alwaies remaine in the ſame. And this is the doctrine of the auncient Fathers, and their expoſition of the places of ſcripture alleaged. Hence in the third ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral<note n="a" place="margin">Concil.

                  <p>I muſt further note in this place, that although the decrees of the Pope (as is before declared) of themſelues, be of an infallible truth, touching the matter which he intendeth to define: yet, that ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther authority (if it be poſſible) is added vnto them, when they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and approued by the whole Church; for if they ſo accepted could be falſe, the whole Church might erre, contrary to that which hath beene proued before.</p>
                  <p>I muſt alſo adde here two groundes more, flowing out of this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Popes judgment from error: In the firſt place are prouinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Councels confirmed by the Pope, for by ſuch only, diuers hereſies haue beene condemned, as that of the <hi>Pelagians, Priſcillianiſts,</hi> of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinian</hi>

And in this ſenſe no <hi>Catholike</hi> nowe affirmeth, that <hi>it is no matter of faith to acknowledge or not acknowledge, the infallibility of the Popes judgment:</hi> for it is held abſolutely to be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith; and conſequently, our doctrine touching theſe points is not <hi>contrary.</hi> True it is,<note place="margin">Bell. li. <hi>4.</hi> de Roman. pontif. ca. <hi>2.</hi> in fine.

Neither doth this their aſſertion, contradict that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly auerred; that the decrees of the Pope without a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in the ſenſe aboue mentioned, are a rock or ground of faith: for although the vvhole Church hath not yet authentically defined, that the Pope after this ſort cannot erre? yet the ſcriptures and other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brought in this behalfe, are ſo plaine and forcible, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of al learned &amp; pious men (except ſome fewe) is ſo conſonant and ſtrong for this point, that euery man may wel admit his definitions, as a ground of ſupernatural faith.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>ONCERNING the teſtimonie of antiquitie touching matters of faith and religion, found in the works of ſuch ancient do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, as from the Apoſtles daies haue flouriſhed through al ages in Chriſts church, and haue been &amp; are eſteemed by her, as fathers &amp; maſters of chriſtian faith; learned men giue vs theſe rules. Firſt thoſe things which they ſay (as it were by the way, and treating of another thing) are to be diſtinguiſhed from ſuch ſentences, as they pronounce of ſuch matters as they purpoſlie handle: for their ſayings of the firſt kinde are of ſmal, thoſe of the other of greater authority. Secondlie, that vvhich is ſaid by anie one of them but once, is not ſo much to be credited, as that which is often and conſtantlie repeated. But principally we muſt make a difference, between that which they ſay in diſputation or contention with their aduerſaries, and that which is affirmed poſitiuelie as a true concluſion, according to the argument of vvhich they treate: for an authority of the firſt ſort is litle to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, of the latter greatlie. Touching their aſſertions in general, this is to be obſerued: Firſt, when the opinion of any father touching matters of faith, is ſinguler and contradicted by al, or moſt of the reſt, it is rather to be thought an errour then a truth. Secondlie, when one or two only affirme a thing of that ſubject, and the reſt make no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, their teſtimonies make a probable, not a certaine argument. Thirdly, what doctrine ſoeuer concerning any point of Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:19127:91"/>
is commonly found in al the auncient Fathers workes, where mention is of that point, and is held by them as an article of the ſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and contradicted by none of the reſt vvithout the note of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, errour, or hereſie impoſed vpon them by others; ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine may wel be thought to pertaine to the rule of faith, deſcending by Tradition from the Apoſtles, and is to be embraced as an article of our beliefe. The truth of this laſt rule vvhich toucheth moſt my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is gathered out of that which hath beene already ſaid; for I haue declared, that neither the Church can erre, nor the tradition of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith in it preſerued be ouerthrowne or altered: but if we admit a poſſibility of error in al ſuch Fathers workes touching matters of ſuch conſequence, both of theſe aſſertions may be proued falſe. For an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in faith found in moſt of the Fathers without contradiction of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, argueth an error in al beleeuers, not only of the ages in which thoſe Fathers flouriſhed, but alſo in al times enſuing; becauſe that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which is deliuered by moſt as an article of faith, without any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of others, may wel be demed to be the doctrine of al the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, who oppoſe not themſelues againſt it, &amp; conſequently of the whole Church. Wherefore, if that be proued erroneous, of it we may inferre an error in al ſorts of chriſtians, &amp; conſequently a change of the rule of faith receiued by tradition. Moreouer, although we ſhould ſet aſide the warrant of the Church and tradition, from errour; who wil think it poſſible that the Fathers ſhould after this ſort depart from the truth, and conſpire in errour without any, or (at the leaſt) without any great contradiction? Is not nouelty commonly diſcouered and oppugned? And of this I gather, that their agrement ſemeth an infallible argument of the truth of their doctrine: yea, that they al held ſincerelie the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deliuered them by their predeceſſors. And this moued the holie fathers aſſembled in general Councels (as appeareth by the acts of the ſaid councels) to make great ſearch into the works of their forefathers, and of the ancient doctors, as alſo to vſe them as a principal meane to finde out the rule of faith, by the ſaid tradition preſerued in the church. Finally, by their teſtimonies to direct very much their definitions and decrees in particuler; <hi>S. Athanaſius</hi> recordeth,<note place="margin">Athanaſ. epiſt. ad Afros.</note> that the Biſhoppes who were preſent in the firſt Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> followed the teſtimonies of the ancient Fathers: and that the ſame was done in thoſe of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> the biſhops themſelues aſſembled alſo teſtify; who affirme in their definitions yet extant, that in them they follow the holy Fathers.</p>

Of which I inferre, that not only the Apoſtles, Prophets, Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, Paſtours and Doctors, who planted, ruled, and inſtructed the Church preſently after Chriſts Aſcention, are to beleeued and obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but alſo, that the like credit is to be giuen to their ſucceſſors, who in al ages following haue ſupplied, and ſhal euer vntil the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſupply their places; and conſequently, that they alſo haue beene and are directed in al truth, otherwiſe they might haue wauered and erred themſelues, and ſo haue drawne the vvhole Church to ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences. Seing therefore, that the fathers of the Church in their ages haue ſupplied ſuch places, it muſt needs followe, that they haue enjoyed the like priuiledges and prerogatiues. Moreouer, the <hi>Iewes</hi> were bound to heare and obey the Scribes &amp; Phariſees of the old law, as we are taught by theſe wordes of Chriſt:<note place="margin">

               <p>Finally, the ancient Fathers are moſt pregnant and faithful witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of that <hi>Depoſitum</hi> or ſumme of Chiſtian doctrine, which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from their predeceſſors, and deliuered to their ſucceſſours.

                  </note> Hence are theſe vvords of <hi>S.

               <p>And howe weake and feeble our reaſon and vnderſtanding is, vve may eaſilie perceiue by this, that it is not able to comprehend the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or cauſes of diuers thinges, vvhich we daily behold with our eies. Hence ariſe ſo many intricate difficulties in natural philoſophy, which the deepeſt wits and moſt learned philoſophers could neuer hitherto vnfold. For example, what philoſopher hath euer hitherto yeelded a certaine cauſe without any contradiction, of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea? Yea, howe manie thinges are there in mans bodie it ſelfe, vvhich moue no ſmal difficulties to philoſophers? as the forming of it in the mothers vvombe, the concoction and diſtribution of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the growing of it to a due proportion and ſtature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What ſhal we ſay of the fiue ſenſes, by which our vnderſtanding cometh to the knowledg of external and corporal thinges? howe ſtrange is their operation? vvhat great and huge bodies are together truely repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the litle compaſſe of the aple of the eie? But I can not ſtand to diſcourſe of them in particuler. If we looke vp to the heauens, howe can we conceiue the huge bodies of the planets, ſeeming to our ſenſes ſo ſmal, their certaine and ſwift motion, and their nature it ſelfe moſt admirable? And if we cannot without great difficulty and diſcourſe, comprehend theſe ordinarie matters, how dare we by our weake wit, meaſure the omnipotent power of God, and think him able to doe no more then we can conceiue?</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if God had not made al thinges of nothing by his onlie word, we ſhould hardly imagine ſuch a creation to be poſſible; ſeing that it is a rule among natural age<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, that of nothing nothing is made.

                  <p>But firſt I muſt declare, that in this ſection I intend not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe al the newe Sectaries of Atheiſme; for I know very wel that they teach &amp; commonly beleeue there is a God: neither doe I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to affirme, that the ſame man can properly be termed a newe ſectarie and Atheiſt; but mine aſſertion onlie is, that a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſuch as are in outward ſhewe profeſſours of the newe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are (in verie deed) inwardlie prophane Atheiſts, and that the ſaid new religion is a very fountaine of Atheiſme.

                     <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift</hi> complaineth, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is repleniſhed with Atheiſts. The ſame complaints haue <hi>Hedio, Powel, Parks,</hi> &amp; others, as wil appeare by ſome of their ſentences which I ſhal relate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. To come therefore to the ſecond part: ſeing that this impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety raigneth nowe more among our aduerſaries, then it hath done in former ages among Chriſtians, in vvhich ſuch monſters vvere not ſo vſuallie found and commonlie ſeene, it is like that it hath ſome roote and ofspring in theſe daies among them, which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not in the religion of our forefathers and predeceſſours. And vvhat is this roote? ſurelie it is not one, but diuers. And for the firſt cauſe of this blaſphemie, I aſſigne their diſſention and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy concerning matters of faith and religion, without any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ground vvhereon to build their beliefe, or meane of ending and deciding ſuch controuerſies as ariſe. That their doctrine is ſubject to theſe inconueniences, it ſhal at larg be proued hereafter. That ſuch diſſention, inconſtancie, vvant of firme grounde and meane to end controuerſies, may truly be ſaid to be roots &amp; foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Atheiſme, it is apparant; becauſe of theſe things may wel be inferred an vncertainty of truth (which is alwaies one and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to her ſelfe) and no diuine foundation of the religion profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,

or reuelations of the truthes preached, becauſe thinges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from God (whoſe wiſedome and prouidence are infinite) cannot be ſubject to ſuch abſurdities. Hence diuers being firſt, by the falſe calumnies &amp; vnjuſt ſlanders of their ring-leaders, cleane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted from our religion, in which onlie a ſure ground, an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable rocke of faith, and a firme piller of truth are found; then in their new profeſſion, being toſſed hither and thither concerning the articles of their faith, and finding no certaine authority where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to reſt, or firme foundation whereon to build a firme and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted reſolution, are brought finallie to this, that they think al articles to be of an vncertaine truth, and conſequentlie imagine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be but a politicke inuention of man, and ſo become A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts. <hi>S.

                  <p>A ſecond reaſon of the multitude of atheiſts among them, I deem to be the liberty which they giue to euery perſon, to examine ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of the high miſteries of Chriſtian religion, by the rule &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their owne feble vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding; &amp; according to their owne fancies to frame interpretations of ſcripture. For this liberty the principal Sectaries hauing taken to themſelues, they haue conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> long ſince noted in <hi>Heretiks</hi>) both by example and otherwiſe giuen the ſame to euery one of their followers.<note place="margin">Tert. de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript. c. <hi>42.</hi> Caluin lib. <hi>4.</hi> Inſtit. cap. <hi>17. § 20.</hi>
                     </note> For example, <hi>Caluin</hi> telleth the defenders of the real preſence, that <hi>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they cry out that they be touched with reuerence of the wordes of Chriſt, whereby they doe not figuratiuely vnderſtand thoſe thinges that were plainely ſpoken: yet, that this is not a pretence rightful enough, why they ſhould ſo refuſe al the reaſons which they object to the contrary.</hi> And what reaſons bringeth he &amp; others againſt it? Their common arguments are: that the ſame body cannot be at the ſame inſtant in ſundry places; that ſo great a corporal body cannot be in ſo ſmal a roome; that the accidents of bread and wine cannot be without a ſubject; that it repugneth to the nature of a body to be wholy in al, and wholy in euery part of the Hoſt. But vvho ſeeth not that by this manner of proceeding and arguing, they giue occaſion to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts to impugne the truth of the B.

For like as they affirme the real preſence to be impoſſible, becauſe the ſame bodie cannot be at the ſame inſtant in ſundry places: ſo may an Atheiſt argue, that it repugneth that the ſelfe ſame nature without any diſtinction ſhould be in three diſtinct perſons, or that the ſelfe ſame bodies beeing once corrupted ſhould riſe againe.

                  <p>And like as this hidden and ſecret denial of the immortallity of the ſoule, is plainly by him confeſſed to raigne in their ſinagogues: ſo a man out of their principles, proceedings, and behauiour, may likewiſe gather the ſame ſecret denial of the being of God, and of his diuine prouidence, of which before.

                  <p>Diuers other ſuch like ſentences, in words ſeeming to containe contradictions, may be found in theſe and other bookes of holie ſcripture, which as I haue ſaid, may moue <hi>Atheiſts</hi> vvith as great reaſon to impugne the authority of the ſaid bookes, as our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries

doe by the like arguments the books of <hi>Tobie, Iudith,</hi> the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees,</hi> and other by vs receiued and by them rejected. Perhaps they wil anſwere, that the ſeeming co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictions which I haue aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned, are in very deed no contradictions, and that the places in appearance contrarie may verie vvel be reconciled. I replie and confeſſe, that in verie truth ſo it is; for al thoſe places by our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, are verie wel ſaued from contrariety and contradiction. And it is manifeſt, that the ſame holy Ghoſt vvho inſpired al the writers of holy ſcripture, cannot contradict himſelfe: and theſe difficulties of holy ſcriprure are onlie to tame our vnderſtanding, and increaſe our merit. But like as theſe places are brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: ſo likewiſe are thoſe and euen with as great caſe, which they alleage to diſproue the authority of thoſe bookes vvhich they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and vve receiue. Neither can an Atheiſt deſirous to impugne both, diſcerne any difference: wherefore I conclude, that by this manner of proceeding they vveaken the authoritie of the vvhole Bible, and offer an occaſion to Atheiſts of rejecting the whole.</p>
                  <p>Vnto this I may adjoine, that <hi>Beza</hi> rejecteth, or (at the leaſt) doubteth of the truth of the whole hiſtorie of the adulterous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, recorded in the eight chapter of <hi>S. Iohns</hi> Goſpel. And why ſo?<note place="margin">Beza in cap. <hi>8.</hi> Ioan.</note> he yeeldeth theſe reaſons. <hi>The great variety of reading, maketh me doubt of the whole matter. To ſpeake opinion, I doe not diſsemble that to be by me worthily ſuſpected, which thoſe auncient writers with ſo great a conſent, either rejected or were ignorant off. Furthermore, that the storie reporteth that Ieſus alone was left in the temple with the woman, I know not how probable it is, and that it writeth that Ieſus wrote with his finger in the ground, ſeemeth to me nouum et inſolitum</hi> a thing ſtrange and not accuſtome, <hi>neither can I conjecture howe it can fitly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated:</hi> thus <hi>Beza.</hi> But if theſe reaſons be ſound and ſufficient, the ſame may juſtlie be pleaded againſt diuers other parcels of holie ſcripture, and conſequently <hi>Beza</hi> by this his manner of arguing, weakneth the authority of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they laugh and ſcoffe at the ceremonies vſed in the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church, by which they induce their followers to think euen as baſely, of diuers ceremonies preſcribed by God in the old lawe.<note place="margin">Leuit. <hi>16.</hi> verſ. <hi>21.</hi> &amp;c.</note> As of that for example, that the high Prieſt ſhould put <hi>both his hands vpon the head of a liue goate,</hi> and <hi>confeſse</hi> ouer him <hi>the ſinnes of the childeren of</hi> Iſrael, and then ſhould ſend away the ſaid goate

I adde alſo that by the ſame rule, they giue an Atheiſt licence to ſcoffe at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers actions of the old Prophets: as of that of <hi>Ahias Selonites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 11. <hi>verſe</hi> 29. 1. <hi>of Kings</hi>

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezech.</hi> 4.</note> when he had him <hi>take a bricke</hi> and <hi>drawe in it the figure of the citty of</hi> Ieruſalem: he commaunded him likewiſe to <hi>ſleep on his left ſide three hundred and ninety daies,</hi> and and in the meane time, to eate daylie a certaine quantitie of bread made of diuers ſorts of graine, and baked in the dung of buls: then to take a raſor and ſhaue off al the haire of his head and beard,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezech.</hi> 5.</note> and by weight to deuide it into three parts; of which, the firſt part he willed him to <hi>burne in the middeſt of the citty;</hi> the ſecond he willed him <hi>to choppe with a knife;</hi> and the laſt he willed him <hi>to ſcatter in the winde.</hi> And truly I ſee no reaſon in the things themſelues, why an Atheiſt ſhould thinke himſelfe more vvorthie of reprehenſion for ſcoffing at theſe actions, then our aduerſaries for running the like courſe againſt our ceremonies. Nay I adde further, that by their ſcoffing at our ceremonies, they offer euil perſons an occaſion to ſcoffe at certaine ceremonies, vſed euen by our Lord himſelfe, and recorded by the Euangeliſtes; I wil exemplifie in one particular. <hi>Caluin</hi> calleth our ceremonie of touching vvith ſpitle the noſtrils and eares of one that is to be baptiſed, before baptiſme,<note place="margin">Calui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. reformat.

                     <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>ridiculous,</hi> and <hi>Willet</hi> calleth it an <hi>interpretiue toy:</hi> But who doth not ſee that this may be a motiue to others, to pronounce the ſame cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt certaine like actions of Chriſt? as that, when healing a man deafe and dumbe <hi>ſpitting he touched his tongue:</hi> or that when gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſight to a blinde man, <hi>He ſpit on the ground &amp; made clay of ſpitle, and ſpred the clay vpon his eies.</hi> I could produce other ſuch examples.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I haue declared aboue, that miracles proceeding from God himſelfe vvho can neither deceaue nor be deceaued, are a

                  <hi>Thou ſeeſt how rich a Chriſtian man is, who although he wil be cannot by neuer ſo great ſinnes looſe his ſaluation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he refuſe to beleeue:</hi> for of this beliefe he ſpeaketh. I intend not here to confute the aſurd aſſertion of our aduerſaries, that faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth juſtifie, which they vnderſtand of this their preſumptuous faith; for this controuerſie belongeth not to this place: only I wil adde a word or two in diſproofe of their ſaid faith, and ſo make an end of this chapter. Firſt therefore it is apparant, that this faith vvas neuer heard of in the vvorld before <hi>Luthers</hi> daies: for there is no deſcription or mention of it in the holy ſcripture, nor in any authour more ancient then himſelfe, as I could eaſily demonſtrate by yeelding the true ſenſe of al thoſe teſtimonies, vvhich are by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19127:109"/>
them brought forth for the confirmation of this their doctrine. Yea <hi>Melanchton</hi> himſelf <hi>Luthers</hi> ſcholler ſeemeth to confeſſe, that it was an inuention of that age;<note place="margin">Melanchton in praefat. in <hi>2.</hi> tom. Luth.</note> for he telleth vs, that <hi>Luther</hi> learned his opnion of an old Frier of his owne order, when as yet he liued in his cloiſter, vvho alleaged for it a certaine ſentence of <hi>S. Bernard</hi> nothing (indeede) to the purpoſe: wherefore it is very probable, that this old Frier gathered his opinion out of certaine wordes of <hi>S.

               <p>Secondly, it is alſo manifeſt that this faith altogether deſtroieth hope, for howe can hope be together vvith an aſſurance and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of ſaluation? It alſo taketh away al feare of ſinne, damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or loſſe of the fauour of God which is ſo highly commended in his holy vvord;<note place="margin">

Moreouer, this faith is a lying and falſe faith, which I proue after this ſort: The power of juſtifying which is in this faith according to <hi>Caluin</hi> and the reſt of his bretheren, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not in the worthineſſe of the worke which is to beleeue, as before hath beene ſignified:<note place="margin">See Willet in Sinopſis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſ. <hi>19.</hi> part. <hi>2.</hi> pag. <hi>827.</hi>
                  </note> neither doth it juſtifie as our worke, for ſo they confeſſe it to be a ſinne; but when this worke of faith is in vs, then God of his only mercy through the merits of Chriſt doth juſtifie vs, and Chriſtes juſtice is made ours: ſo that faith in their opinion, is only the inſtrument by vvhich vve apprehend Chriſtes juſtice, and his juſtice is made ours. Now thus I argue: Either before they beleeue themſelues to be juſt and Chriſtes ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to be theirs, they are juſt in very deede and Chriſt juſtice is theirs, or no? If theſe thinges be true before, then they are not juſtified by this faith: If they be not, then their faith is falſe. For they beleeue that which is not true; becauſe it muſt needs be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that this faith being as it were the inſtrument by vvhich their juſtification is vvrought, is before their juſtification; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19127:109"/>
they beleeue themſelues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſt before they are juſt. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, howe doth this doctrine ſtand with other their poſitions? for doe not they hold, that euery one of the elect being predeſtinate from al eternity is the friend of God, &amp; juſt as ſoone as he hath his being in his mother wombe? Doe not they auerre, that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the faithful are ſanctified for diuers generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s? If they doe not maintaine theſe propoſitions as true, vvhy deny they the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of baptiſme, affirming that infants may be ſaued without it? Why doe they make it only a ſeale of juſtice, not the inſtrument or cause of juſtification or ſanctification? Is it not alſo a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that God doth neuer hate whom once he loued, or loue whom once he hated? theſe thinges truly be ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant that they cannot be denied. But if they be granted it muſt needs alſo be confeſſed, that euery one of the elect (who only can according to their doctrine haue juſtice) were euer juſt, and neuer can be wicked. Of which it conſequently followeth that they are juſt before they can haue actual faith, and conſequently that by faith they are not juſtified.</p>
               <p>I adde alſo, that according to their owne ground nothing is to be beleeued, but that which is expreſly contained in the ſcripture, or manifeſtlie gathered out of the ſame: And vvhere doth euery man finde in the Bible that moſt aſſuredly he is juſt, elect and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be ſaued? verilie no ſuch thing is found? wherefore they doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to their owne rule in beleeuing it. Finally, I haue declared aboue, that faith to be a true Chriſtian faith and to concurre to our juſtification, by vvhich vve beleeue the articles and miſteries of Chriſtian religion; vvherefore, ſeeing that there is but one ſuch faith, this faith of our aduerſaries cannot haue that prerogatiue.</p>
               <p>And hence I inferre, that theſe Sectaries by diſgracing and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the true Chriſtian faith, and eſteeming ſo highly of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged deuiſe of <hi>Luthers</hi> or of his maſters an old Frier, ouerthrowe in effect al Chriſtian faith and religion, or at the leaſt giue their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers a juſt occaſion of contemning the beliefe of ſuch miſteries, as euerie Chriſtian is bound to beleeue. Some man (perhaps) wil ſeeke to free our <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> from this doctrine, becauſe in their publique adminiſtration of baptiſme, they cauſe the miniſter to demaund only of the childe, whether he beleeue the article of the Creed, and make no mention of <hi>Luthers</hi> and <hi>Caluins</hi> ſtrange ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying

Moreouer, their faith is with deſpaire and hatred; ours may be joyned with hope and charitie: wherefore, there is a great difference between our faith and theirs; and our Sectaries doe very euil in making no diſtinction betweene them.</p>

So farre then as the Councel proueth the determination and commandement that in giueth, by the plaine word of God, ſo ſoone doe we reuerence and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19127:113"/>
embraces the ſame:</hi> hitherto the confeſſion of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Out of which their vvordes as alſo out of the like aſſertions of others, I gather; that our aduerſaries commonlie giue no more creditte to general Councels, and conſequently to the whole church of Chriſt, which they repreſent, then is to be giuen to the worſt, and meaneſt man liuing; yea, then may be giuen to the deuil himſelfe. For theſe may alſo be beleeued, if they proue that true which they affirme by the authority of holy ſcripture, which they al require as neceſſary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the decree of councel be beleeued. Secondly I gather, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their aſſertions we may likewiſe lawfully examine theſe their ſentences or decrees, whether they be according to the rule of ſcripture or no, (for they were alſo men ſubject to errour:) and moreouer, becauſe vve finde them not ſo (as appeareth by that which hath beene already ſaid) we may alſo reject them as repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the ſaid ſcripture. The like leaue they giue in like ſort to thoſe of their owne company; yea, to euerie priuate man whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer concerning al their canons and conſtitutions: wherefore, their followers or ſubjects are not to be reprehended according to theſe opinions and decrees, if they examine their ſentences and canons by the word of God; and reject them, if in their conſcience accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their owne judgement, they finde them not conformable to the ſame.</p>
               <p>But what an abſurd thing is it, that a fewe miniſters ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to pronounce ſo ſeuere a cenſure againſt ſuch auncient, vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and learned aſſemblies, highly of eſteemed by al true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in al ages euen ſince the beginning of Chriſtianity? whence wil they haue theſe errours to haue proceeded? Certainly, they muſt needs attribute them either to ignorance, or malice of the Biſhops and Prelates aſſembled. But are they either for number, learning, or piety to be compared with them? They are not without doubt, as wil eaſily appeare vnto any learned man, that ſhal with any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference read the Eccleſiaſtical hiſtories, and viewe the vvorkes of both ſides. Neither haue miniſters being combred for the moſt part with wiues, children and ſuch other impediments, that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of giuing themſelues to ſtudie and deuotion as the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Biſhops had, who liued a chaſt and ſingle life, and gaue them ſelues altogether to ſpiritual affaires, and vvere commonly verie holy men: Wherefore, ſeing that they alſo liued nearer to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19127:113"/>
daies, it is verie probable, yea certaine, that they better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and knewe the true ſence of the word of God, then theſe newe Sectaries doe: and ſeing that their ſanctity was ſo great, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice could no vvaies blinde them. Verilie any indifferent man, if the matter were put to his cenſure (although thoſe ancient Fathers had enjoyed no farther warrant of the aſſiſtance of the holie Ghoſt then theſe newe Goſpellers doe) would rather imagine truth to be with them, then with theſe: But our aduerſaries alleage for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that euery particuler man aſſembled in a general Councel may erre. I anſwere, that true it is that euery particuler man (the Biſhoppe of <hi>Rome</hi> being excepted) is ſubject to errour: but ſeing that the Popes judgement joyned vvith the aſſent of the vvhole Church in a general Councel, is infallible, and in ſuch a caſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be erroneous; and no general Councel is of ſupreame force without his confirmation: it followeth, that the decrees of a lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful general Councel cannot be falſe. The reaſon vvherefore the confirmation of al Councels dependeth ſo much of the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, is, becauſe he is miniſterial head of the Church of Chriſt, and conſequently the bodie muſt needs haue his aſſent and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, before the conſtitutions by it made be of force, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely knowne to be free from errour and falſhood.

               </p>
               <p>Vnto al theſe proofes I adde likewiſe, that our aduerſaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe al the auncient Fathers to haue beene of our beliefe, touching euery article nowe controuerſed betweene vs and them (as I vvil proue in my treatiſe of the definition and notes of the Church) and yet reject their doctrine as erroneous and repugnant to the word of God: vvherefore, they muſt needes confeſſe al the Fathers to

haue erred, and ſo reject their authority. Finally, none of them wil graunt that any conſent of Fathers whatſoeuer, be it neuer ſo general touching any point, is of it ſelfe a ſufficient ground of faith without the teſtimonie of holy ſcripture, which is enough for my purpoſe. But it may be objected by ſome, that diuers of theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries alleage in their vvorkes the holie Councels and Fathers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, not only againſt vs, but alſo againſt their owne bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren diſſenting from them in faith or thinges belonging to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I anſwere that true it is that they ſo doe alleage the holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and Fathers: But doe they make their teſtimonie an infallible ground? they doe not certainelie.

               <p>In defence of our <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> in particular, it may firſt be ſaid, that <hi>M. Iewel</hi> in his challendge, doth challendge to their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, al the Councels and Fathers of the firſt ſixe hundred yeares, alloweth of their authoritie and offereth to be tried by their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. I anſwere firſt, that this challendge made by <hi>M. Iewel</hi> is not general, touching al points controuerſed betweene vs, but concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a fewe only and thoſe not of greateſt moment. Secondly I ſay, that <hi>M.

famous in euery age conſtantly deliuered as matter of faith, and as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from them that went before them, in ſuch ſort that the contradictors and gaine-ſaiers were in their beginnings noted for ſingularity, noueltie, and diuiſion;</hi>

                  <hi>Though al whoſe writings remaine, haue not written of a thing; yet if al that mention it doe conſtantly conſent in it, and their conſent be ſtrengthned by vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal practiſe, we dare not charge them with errour: yea though their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent be not strengthned by ſuch practiſe, if it be concerning thinges ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the word of truth, or by neceſſary and euident deduction to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated from thence, we thinke that no errour can be found ill al them that ſpeake of thinges of that nature,</hi> (that is of matters of ſubſtance, as in the fift chapter) <hi>if in euery age of the Church ſome be found to haue written of them.

And to begin with his three firſt: how wil he proue that they be infallible? how can he ſhewe them to be of diuine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, if the preſent church in al ages (as he ſaith) may erre, and it be true which he affirmeth,<note place="margin">Field book <hi>4.</hi> chapter <hi>20.</hi> § Thus hauing.

                  </note> that <hi>it is not ſafe in things concerning faith to rely vpon traditions?</hi> are not the two firſt rules at the leaſt, receiued by tradition? ſurely he confeſſeth it himſelf. Further, doe not ſome of his brethren cal the creed of the Apoſtles in queſtion, and make it a doubtful matter whether it were deliuered to the Church by the ſaid Apoſtles, or no? he that knoweth not this let him reade <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Hunnius.</hi> Is it in like ſort agreed vpon among our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaties, what articles euery Chriſtian is bound expreſly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and which are contained in the rule of faith? It is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt: and I verily thinke, that ſcarſe any one learned <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> wil admit that euery point, vvhich is aſſigned by <hi>M. Field</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:19127:117"/>
in the fourth chapter of his third booke. Moreouer, how obſcure is the Analogie or proportion, which one thing in matters of faith hath with another? and generally, what man wil admit theſe three rules or any one of them, as ſufficient to make an end of al contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies in the Church? In very deede, although they were al ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by al ſorts as true; yet, very fewe articles can be gathered out of them by ſuch euident deduction, as is able to conuince the vnderſtanding of al men; and conſequently, they are no general and ſufficient directions for al points of our faith.</p>
               <p>Neither are the three laſt rules of themſelues (at the leaſt as they are deliuered by <hi>Field</hi>) of any greater force or ſufficiency. Firſt, becauſe <hi>Field</hi> doth not only make the preſent Church in al ages ſubject to errour (for he freeth it only from damnable and pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious errour:<note place="margin">Field book <hi>4.</hi> chap. <hi>13.</hi> and book <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note>) but alſo affirmeth, that <hi>a right judgment of men by their power of juriſdiction maintaining truth and ſuppreſſing errour, may be wanting in the Church;</hi> and that <hi>ſometimes almoſt al may conſpire againſt the truth, or conſent to betray the ſincerity of the Chriſtian profeſsion:</hi> yea, that <hi>moſt part of thoſe that hold great places of office and dignity in the Church, falling into errour or hereſie, may depart from the ſoundneſſe of the Chriſtian faiths; ſo that truth be maintained by ſome few, and they moleſted, perſecuted, and traduced as turbulent and ſeditious men, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the common peace of the Chriſtian world:</hi> thus <hi>Field.</hi> Which doctrine if we admit as true, what authority ſhal we leaue to the Fathers workes? wil not a poſſibility of errour followe in them al? it cannot be denied: but I need not diſpute any longer of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for <hi>Field</hi> himſelfe of theſe his three rules of beliefe vvriteth thus.<note place="margin">Field book <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Theſe three latter rules of our faith</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we admit not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are equal with the former, and originally in themſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the direction of faith; but becauſe nothing can be deliuered with ſuch and ſo ful conſent of the people of God as in them is expreſſed, but it muſt needes he from thoſe authours and founders of our Chriſtian profeſsion.</hi> Hitherto <hi>Field:</hi> in which words he expreſly graunteth, that theſe rules originally in themſelues are no directions of faith. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, although we could not ouerthrowe them by his owne ſayings, this only vvould ſuffice (according to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> groundes) to proue them to haue no diuine or infallible authority, that he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth no one ſentence of ſcripture, or other proofe for their truth, but only this bare reaſon; that nothing can be <hi>delivered with ſuch
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19127:117"/>
ful conſent, but it muſt needs be from the founders of Chriſtianity.</hi> For if that be thought or affirmed poſſible vvhich he deemeth impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, vvhat force or ſtrength wil be left to his rules? but euerie man may alſo perceiue, that if we admit his aſſertions euen nowe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, concerning the error of the Church and her Prelats; we muſt needes alſo graunt, that it may be al the Fathers haue conſpired in errour. For if al the Fathers of the preſent Church at any time, yea although aſſembled in a <hi>general Councel, may and that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of greateſt conſequence</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>erre:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Field book <hi>4.</hi> chap. <hi>5.</hi> and <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> who ſeeth not that it is a thing poſſible, that in al ages they haue al erred? This notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, let vs nowe looke a litle into the vvordes themſelues of theſe three laſt rules, and behold concerning what articles of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe they are: as alſo, what conditions are required in them as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to this; that out of the Fathers workes (according to <hi>Fields</hi> opinion) vve may gather any article of faith. The firſt of them, which is the fift in order as the words themſelues tel vs, requireth that the matter belong to the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our faith: by which words he doth abridge and limit the authority of the Fathers, to be of force (according to this rule) onlie concerning certaine principal articles by him ſet downe, vvhich euery man (as he ſaith) is bound expreſly to knowe and beleeue. He preſcribeth alſo in this rule, that the conſent be general, that is: not only of al that haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of that matter; but of al that haue left any monuments of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to their poſterity, that al make expreſſe mention of it and without contradiction of any other; and that this is his minde he plainly declareth, in the ſecond and fift chapter before.</p>
               <p>But what errour or hereſie is there, which contentious perſons either wil not deny to pertaine to the ſubſtance of our faith, or that al the monuments of antiquity doe poſitiuely contradict, or which <hi>Heretikes</hi> cannot confirme by ſome, or at the leaſt by one ſentence of ſome auncient writer? Verilie, if they drawe and pul the holie ſcriptures in ſuch ſort to their priuate fantaſies, that no ſect wil be perſwaded but that they fauor the falſe opinions in it maintained: much more may they deale ſo with the writings of their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors which be farre more in number, and not alſo penned as the ſcriptures are by diuine inſpiration.</p>
               <p>The ſecond rule of the three laſt (if <hi>M. Field</hi> wil not haue it to contradict that which I haue added at the end of them, out of the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19127:118"/>
ſecond chapter before) muſt he vnderſtood according to it; and then how vncertaine it is I wil euen nowe declare: but if vve take it as the wordes ſound it cannot be vniuerſal for the deciſions of al points, at the leaſt in the judgment of al men; for al matters are not deliuered as matters of faith, conſtantly &amp; vniformly by the moſt famous Chriſtian writers, and that without contradiction: yea a man of a peruerſe humour although in very deede it were ſo, yet by wreſting and falſe vnderſtanding of ſsuch authors, would make appearance of the contrary. The laſt may be confuted as inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of it ſelfe for the ſame reaſons: for it requireth that the point be of the ſubſtance of faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The addition out of the ſecond chapter requireth vniuerſal practiſe, and neceſſarie and euident deduction out of the ſcripture, or the rule of faith; and (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) that it be a matter of ſubſtance, that in euerie age ſome be found to haue written of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which be things intricate &amp; not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily to be proued in euery matter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſed. But to make al theſe rules more obſcure, he addeth in the fift chapter; that <hi>the writings of the ancient may be much corrupted, ſo that the conſent of antiquity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alwaies eaſily be knowne:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Field book <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>5.</hi> Vincent Liri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenſ. cap. <hi>39.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there wil be euer ſome meanes to finde out and deſcry the errours and frauds of the corrupters.</hi> And ſo he affirmeth himſelfe to vnderſtand that of <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis,</hi> that <hi>the judgment of antiquity is to be ſought out at the very firſt riſing of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, &amp; not afterwards when they are growne inueterate; for that then they wil corrupt the monuments of antiquity.</hi> Finallie, theſe three rules are not ſufficient to direct any man whatſoeuer whether learned or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, to an infallible truth in al articles of faith: for ſeing that euerie priuate man, yea the whole viſible preſent Church is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to errour, and al her greateſt Prelates to hereſie, according to the doctrine of <hi>M. Field,</hi> one man cannot build his faith vpon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others judgement, no not vpon the judgement of the whole pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent viſible Church: wherefore, if we proceed according to <hi>M. Fields</hi> rules, it is not ſufficient to cauſe true faith in vs, that others tel vs that the Fathers and writers of former ages ſay this and that, but we muſt our ſelues read ouer the workes of al ſuch Fathers and authors. And how can the vnlearned doe this? Yea, if a man be neuer ſo learned he cannot doe it, although he doe nothing elſe but read al the daies of his life, and when he hath done al, he is almoſt neuer the nearer; for he cannot deny but he may be deceiued in his
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19127:118"/>
judgment, and conſequently his faith is but an opinion. And thus we ſee, that although <hi>Field</hi> make a great ſhewe of yeelding great authority to the Fathers; yet (in very deed) he bereaueth them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of al, partly by rejecting their teſtimonies concerning al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters but certaine principal and ſubſtantial points; partlie by requiring ſuch a general conſent, as can hardly be proued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the principal articles themſelues; partlie by his doctrine concerning the errour of the whole Church, and partlie by other meanes.</p>

They ſay that they bring vs the authoritie of the worde of God: but the Fathers embraced and reuerenced the word of God more then they doe.

                  <p>It is a common maxime or principle among al newe Sectaries, that the ſcriptures only containe al thinges neceſſary to our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that nothing is to be beleeued or neceſſarily to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, vvhich is not expreſly taught, commaunded, or allowed in the ſame; or (as ſome of them adde) manifeſtlie gathered out of them.<note n="*" place="margin">Harmony of confeſ. ſect. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>In controuerſies of religion</hi> (ſaith the confeſſion of <hi>Heluetia) or matters of faith, we cannot admit any other judge then God himſelfe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing by the holy ſcriptures what is true, what falſe: what is to be followed, or what auoided. Al thinges ought to be tried by the rule and ſquare of holy ſcripture,</hi> ſaith the <hi>French</hi> confeſſion. <hi>Al things which are needful to be knowne to ſaluation, are contained in the Prophets and Apoſtles writings,</hi> ſaith that of <hi>Wittenberg.</hi> And out of this ground they argue againſt vnwritten traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ceremonies, poſitiue lawes
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19127:120"/>
of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that this doctrine is falſe euen according to their owne proceedings (ſuppoſing that to be true vvhich they affirme concerning the infallible authority of the Church, to wit: that it is not expreſſed in the ſaid ſcripture nor out of it deduced) it is an eaſie matter to demonſtrate to euerie mans eie: for firſt this authority of the Church being ſet aſide, by vvhat Scripture can they proue the Scripture it ſelfe to be Canonical. And ſeing that I am to diſcourſe of this argument, and their aſſertions be intricate; I wil not only proue, that according to this ground they haue no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Scripture: but alſo abſolutely, that by no other means they giue it any infallible or diuine authority. Firſt therefore, I may very wel frame this argument againſt the whole Bible, out of their aforeſaid ground: Nothing is to be beleeued but that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly taught in the written word of god, or manifeſtly gathered out of the ſame: but that the Bible is canonical Scripture it is neither taught in the written word of God, nor manifeſtly gathered out of the ſame; therfore it is not to be beleeued that the bible is canonical Scripture. The major or firſt propoſition containeth their afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ground: the minor or ſecond is approued by <hi>Hooker,</hi> who wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thus: <hi>Of things neceſſary the very chiefeſt is, to know what books we are bound to eſteeme holy; which point is confeſſed impoſsible for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelfe to teach.</hi> And this afterwards he confirmeth with this reaſon: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if any one book of ſcripture did giue teſtimony to al; yet ſtil that Scripture which giueth credit to the reſt, would require ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture to giue credit vnto it: neither could we euer come into any pauſe whereon to reſt our aſſurance this way; ſo that vnleſse beſides Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture there were ſomething which might aſſure vs that we doe wel, we could not thinke we doe wel, no not in being aſſured that Scripture is a ſacred and holy rule of wel-doing:</hi> thus <hi>Hooker.</hi> And this argument is of ſuch force, that it hath conſtrained ſome of them, and among the reſt the ſaid<note n="a" place="margin">Hooker in his treatiſ. of lawes of eccle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiaſtical poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, booke <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>84.</hi> book <hi>2.</hi> § <hi>4.</hi> p. <hi>100. 102</hi> Zauch. in his confeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> c. <hi>1.</hi> Brent. in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log.

In this ſenſe I take <hi>Field,</hi> who telleth vs (as I haue partly ſet downe before) that <hi>three thinges concurre to make vs beleeue that, whereof we are doubtful: the light of diuine vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as that whereby we apprehend the things of God: the ſpirit, as the authour of this illumination; and the reaſons and motiues by force whereof the ſpirit induceth, moueth, and perſwadeth vs.</hi> And in particular he affirmeth, that it is not ſufficient for <hi>Stapleton</hi> to ſay that he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the Church to be guided by the ſpirit, <hi>becauſe the ſpirit moueth him ſo to beleeue:</hi> but ſaith it is moreouer neceſſary, that <hi>he declare thoſe reaſons or motiues by force whereof, the ſpirit ſetleth his minde in the perſwaſion of the truth of thoſe thinges he formerly doubted of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some man perhaps wil object, that no miracles (or at the leaſt very fewe) are nowe wrought in the vvorld; vvherevpon it may ſeeme to followe according to this diſcourſe, that Chriſtian <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike</hi> religion is not nowe ſufficiently propounded as credible. I anſwere, that although God doth alwaies cauſe his true religion to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19127:123"/>
be ſufficiently propounded in ſuch ſort, that any vviſe man may prudently embrace it, and beleeue it true: yet (as is aboue inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated) he doth not in euerie reſpect make it ſo credible as is in his power to doe, and that for our greater merit &amp; humiliation. And from this it proceedeth, that among Chriſtians miracles are not nowe ſo frequent, as they were in the primatiue Church; becauſe they haue nowe not only other ſufficient motiues, which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade al men of the truth of their religion; but alſo ſufficient pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential reaſons and marks, by which they may diſcerne the true Church from al falſe ſinagogues, as I haue partly declared before, and wil declare at large in my treatiſe of the definition and notes of the Church.</p>
                  <p>This then being thus proued, let vs behold what prudential ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments our aduerſaries bring to proue the Scriptures to be cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, by force of vvhich <hi>the ſpirit, induceth, moueth, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to beleeue them. Field</hi> (as I euen nowe related) aſſigneth two motiues of our beliefe, vvhich are cauſes of it in two diſtinct ſorts of things: the one, the euidence of the things appearing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs; the other, the authoritie of God himſelfe, vvhome we doe moſt certainly diſcerne to ſpeake in the vvord of faith vvhich is preached vnto vs. <hi>Caluin</hi> ſeemeth to aſſigne the majeſty of God, which preſenteth it ſelfe vnto vs in the diuine Scriptures. <hi>Rogers</hi> ſaith: <hi>The Scriptures cary a diuine and ſacred authority with them, and agree in al points with other bookes of the old Teſtament.</hi> But that none of theſe motiues are ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to perſwade a prudent man, that theſe books are according to the rules of wiſedome, moſt certainely to be accounted diuine and canonical, it is eaſily proued. For firſt if they were ſo, it vvould followe that euerie prudent man reading theſe books, by this only according to prudence ſhould be moued to giue euery one of them this prerogatiue; but this experience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our aduerſaries themſelues (vvho are at variance touching ſome books whether they be canonical or no) proueth falſe: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe motiues are not ſufficient.</p>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19127:123"/>

And firſt this appeareth in thoſe which are brought by <hi>Rogers:</hi> for it is euen as obſcure a matter and as hardly to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that generally al the bookes of Scripture and euery ſentence of them, cary an extraordinary or diuine authority with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue al others, as it is that they are Canonical; ſo is likewiſe their agreement with the books of the old teſtament: wherefore letting them paſſe, let vs behold whether this be not alſo true in ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal reaſons of our faith, as (according to <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Field</hi>) moue vs to beleeue. And firſt, vvhence proceedeth that euidence vvhich <hi>Field</hi> vvil haue in ſome thinges beleeued to appeare vnto vs? Are the articles of our faith euident in them ſelues? this he denieth of ſome: for,<note place="margin">Field book <hi>4.</hi> Chapter <hi>8.</hi> § The opinion.</note> 
                     <hi>We confeſſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that faith may rightly be ſaid to be a firme aſſent, without euidence of many of the things beleeued in themſelues; but the</hi> medium <hi>by force whereof we are to beleeue, muſt be euident vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, as</hi> Durandus <hi>doth rightly demonſtrate:</hi> thus <hi>Field.</hi> But can he make it good, that any ſuch articles are in themſelues euident vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, as they are the object of our faith? It is plaine that moſt of them, yea almoſt al conſidered howſoeuer, haue not ſo much of themſelues in reſpect of our vnderſtanding, as euidence and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety of credibility, that is: they appeare not ſo certaine and credible vnto vs, as a prudent man would beleeue them, ſetting aſide the <hi>medium</hi> or meane ſupernatural, by vvhich they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. But if vve conſider them preciſely as they are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our faith, they al haue no other euidence then diuine reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as is proued before; which is alwaies obſcure. What then is this <hi>medium</hi> or meane according to <hi>Field?</hi> Is it any humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, motiue, or probability? This cannot be according to his owne doctrine, as appeareth in the ſame place and the chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Nay in another place he telleth vs,<note place="margin">Book <hi>4.</hi> chap. <hi>20.</hi> § Much contention.</note> that <hi>the books of Scripture winne credite of themſelues, and yeeld ſufficient ſatisfaction to al men of their diuine truth:</hi> and therefore he ſeemeth to exclude al external proofe. Is it then any thing contained in the things themſelues? Neither can this be ſaid: for euery thing contained in the thinges themſelues &amp; belonging to their eſſence, is as obſcure as the things
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19127:124"/>
themſelues be; and conſequently, no ſuch thing contained in the things themſelues, can be ſuch a meane to manifeſt themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. And vvhat accident he vvil aſſigne in the articles of our faith, making them manifeſt vnto vs, I cannot imagine. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I cannot ſee how this aſſertion of <hi>Field</hi> doth agree with that his common principle,<note place="margin">Field book <hi>4.</hi> chap. <hi>13.8.</hi> book <hi>3.</hi> chap. <hi>42.</hi>
                     </note> auouching that the Scripture <hi>is the Canon</hi> and ground of their beliefe, and <hi>that they reſt in the determination of the word of God, as in the rule of their faith:</hi> For how can this be, if the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of the things appearing vnto vs, be ſometimes the formal reaſon of our faith, as is in like ſort by him auerred. But to make this diſcourſe a litle more manifeſt, let vs demaund a queſtion or two in particuler of <hi>M. Field,</hi> and ſee howe he vvil reſolue them according to his doctrine deliuered. I aske therefore of him, why he beleeueth there be three perſons and one God, two natures in Chriſt and one perſon, and the reſurrection of our bodies? Wil he anſwere that the euidence of the thinges appearing vnto him, is the formal cauſe of his faith, or inducing him to beleeue theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries? If he doe not, he contradicteth his own doctrine: If he doe, he contradicteth both al ſenſe and reaſon, and alſo himſelfe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Scripture the ground of faith; except he affirme theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries to be euident not in themſelues, but in the <hi>medium</hi> or meane, by force whereof they are beleeued: For which <hi>medium</hi> if he wil be conſtant to himſelfe he muſt aſſigne the holie Scripture; vvhich Scripture, he muſt ſay is beleeued through the authority of God himſelfe, whome vve doe moſt certainly diſcerne to ſpeake in the word of faith, which is another cauſe of beliefe aſſigned by him, for ſuch thinges as we beleeue and doe not knowe: ſo that this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God is the laſt motiue, not the holy Scripture; and what other proceſſe he wil make I cannot perceiue. But what doth he and <hi>Caluin</hi> vnderſtand by that other reaſon, which he tearmeth <hi>The authority of God himſelfe, whome we doe certainly diſcerne to ſpeake in the word of faith which is preached vnto vs;</hi> and <hi>Caluin, The maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of God which doth preſent it ſelfe vnto vs?</hi> What is this authority and majeſty of God? and how doe we ſo certainly diſcerne it. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily for my part, I am ſo farre from knowing how to diſcerne it, as I cannot vvel imagine vvhat they meane by it; yet, if I be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued they affirme, that the authority of God or his majeſtie is ſeene in the letter of holie Scripture, vvhich moueth vs by a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19127:124"/>
and moſt infallible aſſent, to acknowledge it to be his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly word. But firſt this is ſaid <hi>gratis,</hi> and vvithout any ground or reaſon: for what authority or majeſty can a man diſcerne in ſuch bookes as our aduerſaries receiue as Canonical, more then in thoſe which they reject? For example, what appeareth to vs more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine in the bookes of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> then in the bookes of <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus?</hi> ſurely nothing; much leſſe, ſo much as may be an infallible and knowne meane to moue vs to beleeue the one as diuine, and to reject the other as Apocriphal.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, howe doe vve knowe that this repreſentation of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine majeſtie, or this diuine authoritie, vvhich as vve conceaue doth repreſent it ſelfe vnto vs, is not either ſome illuſion of the Deuil, or ſome ſtrong imagination of our owne proceeding on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie from ſome affection, which vpon ſome other motiues we beare to ſuch and ſuch bookes of Scripture? Trulie we haue great cauſe to feare that it may proceed from ſome ſuch affection, ſeeing that <hi>Luther,</hi> and moſt of al his <hi>Lutherans</hi> confeſſe, al the <hi>Sacramenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> generallie to be deceaued in ſuch their apprehenſions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> the epiſtle of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> the Apocalipſe of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> and other parcels of Scripture. And why not concerning others as vvel as theſe? Vnto vvhich I adde, that they commonly make their doctrine a rule whereby to try which is Scripture and vvhich is not, as I vvil demonſtrate hereafter, and appeareth by the cauſes aſſigned by <hi>Luther,</hi> vvhich moued him to reject the epiſtle of Saint <hi>Iames.</hi> It may alſo be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this their doctrine, that of it it ſeemeth to followe, that no man can be aſſured of the diuine authority of any other bookes of Scripture, then of thoſe which he hath read himſelfe, or heard others read: For firſt no man can poſſibly proue to another that in reading ſuch and ſuch books, he did diſcerne in then the authority of God himſelfe ſpeaking, or that the diuine majeſty did in them preſent it ſelfe vnto him: vvherefore vnto this, that a man may judg of holy Scripture, he muſt himſelfe read, or heare the words and ſentences read, and this he muſt doe before he can haue any faith. For ſeeing that they make the Scripture the rule and ground of their beliefe, the Scripture muſt firſt be knowne before they can beleeue: and ſeeing that no one booke containeth al things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be beleeued, but ſuch things are diſperſed through al, it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19127:125"/>
is neceſſarie that he know the whole Canon of Scripture; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie, that he reade or heare it al rehearſed ſentence by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. And what a Laborinth is this? how can the vnlearned that cannot reade, doe it? Nay how many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the world haue euer performed it? Wherefore I conclude, that this rule or meane how to know holy Scripture, is neither eaſie, plaine, certaine, nOr vniuerſal. Perhaps it may be thought by ſome, that <hi>Field</hi> aſſigneth the euidence of the thinges appearing vnto vs in holy Scriptures, as the formal cauſe of our beleefe concerning their authority: but this cannot be, both becauſe our beleefe concerning their Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical authority, ſeemeth to be concerning a matter of fact, to wit: vvhether they vvere penned by the inſtinct of the holie Ghoſt or no; as alſo becauſe a great part of them rehearſeth matters of fact, which <hi>Field</hi> denieth to be knowne by the authority of God himſelfe, whome we doe certainly diſcerne to ſpeake in the word of faith.<note place="margin">Field book <hi>4.</hi> chapt. <hi>15.</hi>
                     </note> Adde likewiſe that by his confeſſion they are obſcure, which obſcurity partlie (as he ſaith) ariſeth through the high and excellent nature of the thinges in them contained, which if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, the thinges contained in the Scripture, be no good meane for vs to come to the knowledge of Scripture. And moreouer, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is that the euidence of thinges contained in the Scripture, is no more manifeſt vnto vs, then the Scriptures themſelues: and therefore for this reaſon alſo, it cannot be any good <hi>Medium</hi> to proue theſe Canonical. <hi>Field</hi> and al his fellowes, to al theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons objected againſt them ſeeme to anſwere, that in very deede theſe motiues of themſelues are not ſufficient, to perſwade euerie man of the diuine truth of theſe bookes: yet, that they are fullie ſufficient to perſwade him that is endued with the habite of faith, or hath a diuine illumination or inſpiration of the ſpirit, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to reade the Scriptures vvith pure eies and perfect ſenſes; yea <hi>Caluin</hi> in his whole diſcourſe touching the knowledge of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Scripture, ſeemeth altogether to flie to diuine inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whence proceed theſe his ſentences.<note place="margin">Caluin Inſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>The manner of perſwaſion</hi> (touching the diuine truth of Scriptures) <hi>muſt be fetched euen from the ſecret teſtimonie of the holy Ghoſt: They doe diſorderly, that by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation trauaile to eſtabliſh the perfect credite of the Scripture. The word of God ſhal neuer finde credit in the hearts of men, vntil it be ſealed vp with the inward witneſſe of the holy Ghoſt. They whom the holy Ghoſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19127:125"/>
hath inwardly taught, doe wholie reſt vpon the Scripture: Though by the only majeſty of it ſelf it procureth reuerence to be giuen to it; if then only it throughly pearceth our affections, when it is ſealed in our hearts by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt:</hi> hitherto are <hi>Caluins</hi> wordes.</p>
                  <p>I reply, firſt that this taketh not away the neceſſity of reading, or hearing read euery ſentence of theſe diuine bookes, before we can knowe them to be Canonical, or diſcerne what we are bound to beleeue. Secondly of this it followeth, that before a man can diſcerne whether any booke be Canonical or no, he muſt not only haue faith or a ſupernatural light of the holy Ghoſt: but muſt alſo, moſt aſſuredly and infallibly knowe himſelfe to haue ſuch a faith, or ſuch an illumination. And how wil they make vs beleeue this, and alſo perſwade vs that the Scripture is the ground and rule of our beliefe, which likewiſe they euen as earneſtly teach? can pure eies, perfect ſenſes, and the light of faith be had without knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that, which is the verie ground and rule of faith? Muſt not the ground be knowne and had, before vve can attaine vnto that which is built vpon the ſaid ground? If it muſt, and the whole Canon of Scripture be the ground of our faith as they ſay; then muſt the whole Canon of Scripture be infalliblie knowne, before vve can haue ſuch faith; and conſequently, the light of faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a meane, whereby we are to come to the knowledge of the ſaid Canon of Scripture, or any parcel thereof. But becauſe al Sectaries vſually both in this and other pointes, ſeeme moſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vpon the inſpiration and illumination of the ſpirit; by which (as they ſay) al matters are made euident vnto them, and they are aſſured of the diuine truth of them, although to others not enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened the ſame matters ſeeme doubtful, from vvhence it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that <hi>Field</hi> affirmeth themſelues <hi>to reſt in the light of diuine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi>

And firſt thus I argue: If there be ſuch a certaine illumination or inſpiration, either God by this illumination or inſpiration, doth ſo teach and direct euerie man concerning euery article of faith, that they cannot erre; or ſome men only, and thoſe only touching ſome articles. That he doth not ſo direct al concerning al articles, it is euident and confeſſed by

                  <p>Let vs nowe apply ſome of theſe general reaſons, to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Scripture by illumination in particuler, and alſo vrge them a litle further.

For did none of the Fathers judge ſuch bookes Canonical, as al <hi>Proteſtants</hi> commonly reject? it cannot be denied but they did: for it is euident,<note place="margin">Field book <hi>4.</hi> chap. <hi>23.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cil.

                     </note> and this ſeemeth to be their common opinion. Againſt which I oppoſe; firſt that of this would followe, that there is no certaine rule in the Church, whereby al men may come to a certaine knowledge of Gods word: which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion is verie abſurd, eſpecially if the written vvord of God be the only rule of faith as they contend. Secondly, the Scripture yeeldeth vs no warrant for a diuine aſſurance of any ſuch inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that there is any ſuch in the Church. They wil ſay that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſentences of the vvord of God plainely approue it, but the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19127:127"/>
contrary is already ſhewed: and beſides this is to fal into a circle, by prouing the truth of Scriptures by diuine inſpirations, or illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations; and the truth of this againe by Scripture. Thirdly, it cannot be proued by Scripture, that this inſpiration (if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch) is particular to ſome, and not common to al. Fourthly, although we ſhould grant this to ſome, yet no man can by any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Scripture or prudential ground, aſſuredlie knowe that he hath ſuch an inſpiration; eſpecially conſidering firſt, that diuers ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries haue beene deceiued &amp; falſly pretended ſuch inſpirations, as appeareth by their contrariety. Nay I may further adde, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther al <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are now deceiued in their judgement concerning certaine bookes, or els that <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> with the whole Councel of <hi>Carthage</hi> erred touching them in times paſt, as appeareth by that which is ſaid a litle before; and no man wil deny but an error in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe, giueth a man juſt cauſe to miſtruſt his owne illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For certaine it is, that <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> was guided by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as farre forth as any Sectarie. Secondly, his judgement may alſo growe doubtful out of this, that the ſame man may haue (as they ſay) a diuine inſpiration touching one booke, and be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued touching another;<note place="margin">Stocke and Whitakers in the anſwer to Duraeus, the firſt reaſon. pag. <hi>48.</hi>
                     </note> for ſo ſaith <hi>Stocke</hi> out of <hi>Whitakers,</hi> who telleth vs, that <hi>Al thinges are not reuealed to al alike,</hi> and that <hi>al haue not the ſame meaſure of the ſpiritte:</hi> Out of vvhich he draweth an excuſe of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> if they beleeued vvel of ſome, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected not vvel other bookes of Scripture; and this likewiſe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be gathered out of <hi>Caluin</hi> aboue cited. Fiftlie, others haue no meanes to knowe vvho receiueth ſuch an inſpiration; and conſequently, it only profiteth the man himſelfe who hath it, and no other perſon: this cannot be denied; for <hi>Luther</hi> boaſted of the ſpiritte as farre forth as <hi>Caluin,</hi> yet they diſagreed concerning the Canonical books, and were of different faiths. And what reaſon haue we, either to graunt or deny this inſpiration more to the one then to the other? or vvhat arguments can be brought by the one which cannot be vſed by the other? yea of this I infer further, that neither of them had any ſuch diuine inſpiration; for ſeeing that both were not inſpired with the holy Ghoſt, and one of them had no ſtronger proofes for his inſpiration then the other, we ought to giue no more credit to the one then to the other: and ſeing that we cannot beleeue them both, vve cannot according to reaſon credit
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19127:127"/>
either of them. And in very deed, neither of them is able to bring any certaine reaſon or authority, able to perſwade any other that he hath a ſupernatural inſpiration, ſhewing that this and that is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcripture. Finally, of this whole opinion follow two other great inconueniences or abſurdities: firſt, it giueth euery man licence to reject and admit books of holy Scripture, out or into the Canon at his pleaſure according to his fancy; for there is no Sectary but may alleage the maieſty of the letter, the euidence of thinges contained in it, pure eies, and perfect ſenſes, the light of grace or internal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, for the proof of his owne particuler opinion concerning canonical Scripture, &amp; that with as great probability as any other Sectary be he <hi>Lutheran, Sacramentary,</hi> or of what other ſect ſoeuer: Neither can this refel him, vnleſſe they refute themſelues. In like ſort if he deny theſe proofes to any book whatſoeuer, no man can conuince him of error: and of this may follow without any certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, almoſt as many opinions of this matter, as there be heads. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by this allowance of an inſpiration, for the proofe of the letter of canonical Scripture, the way is opened to the allowance of priuate inſpiration alſo, for the knowledg of the true ſenſe and expoſition of the ſame; vvhich is denied by <hi>Field,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Field booke <hi>4.</hi> chap. <hi>16.</hi>
                     </note> and is in very deed a very fountaine of diſcord and confuſion. But what proofs can they bring for the one, which cannot be applied to, yea not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel proue the other? And theſe reaſons (as I imagine) moued the authors before named, to flie from this priuate inſpiration to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and the authority of the Church. Vnto whome in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I may adde the whole <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church of <hi>England,</hi> who in their ſixt article agreed vpon in their conuocations of the yeares 1562. and 1604. affirme, that <hi>in the name of holy Scripture, they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe Canonical books of the old and newe Teſtament, of whoſe authority was neuer any doubt in the Church:</hi> for they ſeeme to make the authoritie and Tradition of the Church, the meane and rule vvhereby to knowe the diuine Scriptures.<note place="margin">Field booke <hi>4.</hi> chap. <hi>14.</hi>

Neither ſhould he only bring a diuine proofe for theſe matters, but alſo to ſhewe the certaintie of his ſupernatural illumination, of vvhich al theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.

Many places of Scripture are alleaged out of the vvritten vvord of God by our aduerſaries, to proue the certainty of priuate illuminations: and ſeing that I can not ſtand to giue the true ſenſe of them, I deſire my reader only to conſider in general, that ſuch ſentences as they alleage (if they proue any thing for them, and are to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as they pretend) proue the judgement of euerie Chriſtian man, or at the leaſt of euery ſpiritual man to be infallible: vvhich being falſe, as appeareth both in the auncient Fathers, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in themſelues; vve may vvel inferre that they haue ſome other ſenſe.</p>

                     <hi>SECTION THE SECOND.</hi> In which the ſame argument is proſecuted, and two thinges principallie are proued. Firſt, that the newe Teſtament receiueth ſmal authority (if we beleeue our aduerſaries) by this that it was written by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Diſciples, becauſe they accuſe them of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Secondlie becauſe they confeſſe the text of Scripture to be corrupted.</head>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, by the teſtimony of the old; ſome perhaps wil ſay, that the authority of the old is confirmed and ratified by the newe. But how is the newe it ſelfe proued to be Canonical? which preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue if we deny it, the old wil receiue but litle credit from it. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture they wil anſwere, that they knowe the newe to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, becauſe it vvas vvritten by the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt inſpired by the holy Ghoſt. I reply and demaund, firſt, how they can proue this to be true by canonical Scripture? What canonical Scripture for example (if we deny the ſaid Goſpel to be Canonical) telleth vs that <hi>S. Mathew</hi> the Apoſtle wrote that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which vve terme <hi>S. Mathewes</hi> Goſpel? Secondly, although we ſuppoſe it to be true, that the Apoſtles and Diſciples were the authours of the newe Teſtament, yet howe can they proue that in penning it they haue not erred? What canonical Scripture haue they for this? Certainely our aduerſaries make al their ſucceſſours ſubject to errour; wherefore it ſeemeth, that they wil not be very ſcrupulous to graunt it of the Apoſtles and Diſciples themſelues.</p>

                     <hi>If it be ſo as</hi> Auguſtine <hi>&amp;</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome <hi>report, I thinke that the Apoſtles ſuffered certaine to pray for the dead, for no other cauſe then to condiſcend to their infirmity:</hi> hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Zuinglius;</hi> in which words he confeſſeth that the Apoſtles wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſuffered ſome to erre, vvhich could not be done without er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in themſelues. And out of al theſe aſſertions of our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, in which they either accuſe the vvriters of holy Scripture of errour, or make them ſubject thereunto, I inferre; that the newe Teſtament may containe errours, although we ſhould graunt it to be written by the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But let vs alſo adde, that although we ſhould graunt them that the Apoſtles and Diſciples could not erre in penning theſe ſacred bookes: yet that it is a hard matter for them to proue, that the new Teſtament ſince their daies, hath not either through negligence or malice beene corrupted. For had not the <hi>Catholiks</hi> their enemies, by their owne confeſſion the keeping of it for the ſpace of diuers hundreds of yeares? how know they then that the ſaid <hi>Catholikes</hi> to ſerue their owne turnes, haue not corrupted it? Surely they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their owne bretheren to haue falſified it vvithin fewe yeares, in diuers places: wherefore, one ſect rejecteth the tranſlation of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Doe they then thinke vs and our predeceſſors, more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere then they are themſelues? Perhaps ſome ignorant man wil ſay, that it hath beene alwaies in the cuſtody of thoſe of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19127:131"/>
but it is certaine; that they cannot poſſibly aſſigne any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of men of their profeſſion, that could alwaies keepe it. I demaund alſo (if any man wil needes ſay that there were ſuch men, although inviſible in the vvorld, and mentioned off by no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of anie one age ſince the Apoſtles dayes) vvhether they were <hi>Lutherans, Zuinglians</hi> or <hi>Caluiniſts,</hi> or of vvhat other ſect? If they were <hi>Lutherans,</hi> howe doe the <hi>Zuinglians, Caluiniſts,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sectaries knowe that they kept it ſincerely and truly? if they were <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> howe doe the <hi>Lutherans</hi> knowe the ſame? The like queſtion I demaund concerning other Sectaries, and none of them I thinke wil be ſo abſurd, as to ſay that al theſe ſects haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beene in the world.</p>

                  <p>And out of this diſcourſe it is euident, firſt that our aduerſaries cannot proue by Canonical Scripture, that the Scripture it ſelfe is Canonical; ſecondly, that they cannot proue that the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was written by the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt; thirdly, that although this be admitted, yet that they cannot proue that the ſaid Apoſtles and Diſciples in penning it did not erre; laſtly, that they cannot proue the Scriptures to remaine ſincere and not corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted: yea I haue declared, that they confeſſe that the Apoſtles and Diſciples were ſubject to errour, and that the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> text which they eſteeme aboue al others, is corrupted. Out of al vvhich poſitions ſo manifeſtly proued, I conclude; that the bare vvordes of Scriptures are not a ſufficient ground of Chriſtian faith and religion. And although this argument concerning the vvhole Bible, and in particular touching the new Teſtament, be inuincible and inſoluble; yet, a farre greater difficulty there is according to their ground mentioned, that nothing is to be beleeued, but that which is expreſly contained in the Scripture, or gathered out of the ſame concerning thoſe bookes of Scripture, which haue long after the Apoſtles daies beene in the Church of doubtfull authority (of which before) and yet are now receiued by our aduerſaries into the Canon. For vvhat one ſentence of the vvord of God remouing al doubt, declared their authority to be diuine? Surely after the doubt had of them, there was no Scripture written; and before, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the ſaid Scripture was not decided: wherefore, if we allowe the Scriptures only to be a ſufficient judge of ſuch controuerſies, our aduerſaries themſelues contrary to their owne proceedings, muſt of neceſſity be forced to confeſſe ſuch parcels of Scripture, to be as yet of doubtful authority.

                     <hi>SECTION THE THIRD.</hi> The ſame is proued, becauſe euery Chriſtian is bound to admit and beleeue certaine propoſitions, neither expreſly contained, nor (according to ſome mens judgements) ſo euidently gathered out of the holy Scripture.</head>
                  <p>SECONDLY it is apparant, that the bare letter of holy Scripture, and concluſions out of it manifeſtly deduced by euery priuate man, ſetting a ſide the authority of the Church (as aboue) are not a ſufficient ground or rule of Chriſtian beliefe and religion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe euery true Chriſtian is bound to admit and beleeue, certaine propoſitions concerning the miſteries and articles of our faith, which are not expreſly contained in the letter, nor (as ſome of them thinke) ſo euidently deduced out of the ſame, eſpecially if we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of our aduerſaries Commentaries. The firſt is eaſily proued; for where doe we finde in the vvhole Bible the wordes, <hi>Trinity, perſon,</hi> and <hi>conſubſtantial?</hi> and yet moſt of the Profeſſors of the new religion vvil not denie, but that euery Chriſtian vnder paine of damnation, is bound to beleeue and admit in expreſſe tearmes theſe propoſitions following: There is a Trinity, there be three perſons in the bleſſed Trinity; the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and the holy <hi>Ghost</hi> are conſubſtantial the one to the other, and ſuch like: yea <hi>Beza</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth, that without the vſe of theſe wordes,<note place="margin">Beza lib. de hereticis a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uili magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu puniendis, pag. <hi>51.</hi> alſo in Ep.

                     </note> the truth of thoſe miſteries cannot be explicated, nor the deniers of them confuted; And it is manifeſt, that whoſoeuer rejecteth theſe wordes doth open the gappe to <hi>Iudaiſme, Arianiſme,</hi> and <hi>Turciſme.</hi> But ſome of them flie to deduction out of Scriptures; and anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were, that although the wordes are not expreſly found in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet that the miſteries themſelues are expreſly in it contained and deliuered; and conſeqnently, that the wordes aptly ſignifying the ſaid miſteries, and deduced out of the word of God it ſelfe, may very wel and conueniently be vſed. I reply that this is not ſufficient: for euery priuate mans deduction is ſubject to errour, except it be by an infallible argument, and euery propoſition be moſt euidently true, in that ſenſe in which it is alleaged: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19127:134"/>
ſuch deductions as our aduerſaries commonly vſe, make no articles of faith: Secondly, the collections themſelues of theſe high miſteries, (by reaſon of the obſcurity and diuerſity of ſenſes of the holy Scripture) are not ſeldome obſcure; and therefore thoſe col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections vvhich to ſome ſeeme euident, by others are judged falſe. Hence the collection of thoſe very miſteries which I haue named, by diuers of our aduerſaries is denied; as by <hi>Valentinus Gentilis</hi> and his followers,<note n="a" place="margin">Valent.

For out of theſe groundes ſome of the preciſer
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19127:134"/>
ſort of them argue, that we ought not to admit into our beliefe, or vſe in the explication of out faith, any wordes not contained and expreſſed in the word of God. For (ſay they) the Scripture being ſo ſufficient, vvherefore ſhould vve vſe any vvordes inuented by man? what neede haue we of any ſtrange deductions, or any other thing? If theſe wordes be admitted, we may euen aſwel admit the word, <hi>tranſubſtantiation,</hi> &amp; other new inuentions of the <hi>Papists,</hi> &amp;c. thus the preciſer ſort and the enemies of the bleſſed Trinity di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute. And to diſcourſe a little more at large of the word, <hi>tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation;</hi> Aſke an <hi>Engliſh Protestant</hi> what reaſon he hath to reject it? He wil anſwere, both becauſe it is not found in the Scripture, and alſo becauſe the thing by it ſignified (to wit, the changing of bread and wine into the body and bloud Of Chriſt) is not collected out of the ſame. Demand likewiſe of an <hi>Arian</hi> vvhy he admitteth not the vvord <hi>conſubſtantial?</hi> He wil anſwere, becauſe neither the vvord it ſelfe is vſed in holy writ, nor the thing ſignified thereby, (to vvit: that the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt are of the ſame ſubſtance) truly gathered out of the ſame. Behold the anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were of both is one, and certainely the reaſon yeelded ſerueth both alike; for like as the vvord <hi>tranſubſtantiation,</hi> ſo the word <hi>conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial</hi> is not found in the Scripture, but both theſe vvordes haue beene appropriated by the Church, to ſignifie more diſtinctly and plainely miſteries expreſſed truly in the word of God, but not ſo plainely: vvherefore, if one of them be rejected, the other cannot be receiued. They ſay, that the thing ſignified by the word <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi> is not in expreſſe tearmes to be found in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. I reply, that like as the real preſence by the confeſſion of their owne bretheren the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> is ſo plainely deliuered vnto vs by the Euangeliſts, that it cannot be denied (which neuertheleſſe by them is vtterly rejected:) ſo likewiſe is <hi>tranſubſtantiation.</hi> And like as if we admit of their tranſlations, and interpretations of holy Scripture, neither the real preſence, nor tranſubſtantiation is out of them gathered: ſo in like ſort, neither is the miſtery ſignified by the vvord <hi>conſubſtantial</hi> gathered out of the ſaid Scripture, if vve admit the tranſlations and interpretations of the <hi>Arians.</hi> Yea I dare boldly affirme, that if vve allowe but of <hi>Caluins</hi> Commentaries vpon the Scriptures (which ſome of our<note n="a" place="margin">Hooker in the preface to his booke of eccleſ. pollicy pag. <hi>9.</hi> Couel in his defence of Hooker.</note>

                  <p>Further, ſeing that the Scriptures admit ſenſes ſo diuers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret not themſelues, and the falſe ſenſe is ſo dangerous; howe can any man be aſſured by the bare vvordes, that he hath attained to the true ſenſe?

Adde alſo, that the diuers and large Commentaries vpon the Scriptures, and the great ſtudy of al ſorts concerning the expoſition of them, are euident arguments, that the bare vvordes of Scripture may receiue diuers and falſe interpretations: yea eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man muſt of neceſſity graunt, that ſome of our learned aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries themſelues expound them falſly, ſeing that their expoſitions be repugnant and contrary.

                  <p>The common anſwere of our aduerſaries to this argument is,<note place="margin">See before part. <hi>2.</hi> chap. <hi>5.</hi> ſect. <hi>1.</hi> in the beginning</note> that one place of Scripture expoundeth another; and therefore if the vvordes of any place be of doubtful ſenſe, they bid vs conferre them vvith other ſuch like ſentences: but this anſwere may be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refelled. For like as the place in controuerſie or doubtful, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth diuers interpretations; ſo doe alſo thoſe other places vvith vvhich they vvould haue it conferred: vvherefore, by this confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence diuers times vve are neuer the neare for attaining to the true ſenſe; yea not ſeldome, by ſuch conference the difficulty is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as appeareth by thoſe places before alleaged,<note place="margin">

contrary one another. Hence our newe ſectaries themſelues being diuided into diuers ſects, and hauing conferred a longe time ſuch places together as are controuerſed among them, cannot as yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree about the true ſenſe of the ſaid places, but remaine ſtil at mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal jarres.

Let vs therefore conclude, that the true ſenſe of the Scripture is not ſufficiently gathered out of the bare vvordes; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let vs not admit the bare vvordes to be a ſufficient ground of Chriſtian religion. And hence I gather, that our aduerſaries haue no certainty of faith and religion; which is apparent, becauſe they make the naked letter of holy Scripture the only ground of their beliefe, the true ſenſe of vvhich vnto them is alwaies very vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: for either the aſſurance vvhich euery one of them hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from his owne reading and judgement, or from the credit of ſome other Miniſter or Miniſters, vvho interpret the Scriptures in that ſenſe vvhich he embraceth; both vvhich meanes be moſt vncertaine. For they depend vpon the judgement of priuate men, vvho haue no aſſurance from the holy Ghoſt of not erring;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19127:137"/>
vvherefore they are ſubject to errour; and conſequently, none of them haue any further aſſurance of the truth of their religion, then humane judgement.</p>
                  <p>Vnto the reaſons already brought for the proofe of the title of this Chapter, I adde theſe that followe, partly gathered out of that vvhich hath beene already ſaid in this Treatiſe: firſt, that the rule of Chriſtian faith ought to be general and ſufficient for al ſorts of people, vvhich cannot appertaine to the bare letter of holy Scripture, becauſe diuers perſons cannot reade; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to knowe the contents of the Bible, they muſt vſe the helpe of ſome of the learned, and vpon their report (vvhich may be falſe and erroneous) build their beliefe. It is alſo manifeſt, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had ſome other rule of faith, before the Scriptures of the newe Teſtament vvere vvritten. Finally I haue already proued, that together vvith the letter we ought to receiue that ſenſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, vvhich hath by tradition and ſucceſſion deſcended from the Apoſtles: And thus much concerning this matter.</p>

concerning euery article betweene vs in controuerſie. Neither doe I ſpeake of their forſaking and corrupting of the true ſenſe of the <hi>Latin</hi> vulgare edition, but of the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> text it ſelfe, which they profeſſe to followe.</p>
                  <p>But before I come to this matter, I muſt forewarne my reader that although our <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſectaries haue ſet forth diuers Bibles in their vulgar tongue; yet I intend eſpecially to ſpeake of three of the principal: of which the firſt vvas authoriſed by <hi>Cranmer</hi> called Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and read during al King <hi>Edwards</hi> raigne in their Churches, and (as it ſeemeth by the newe printing of it in the yeare 1562.) during a great part alſo of the raigne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> The ſecond vvas printed in the yeare 1577. and againe as I thinke, in the yeare 1595. and is authoriſed likewiſe to be read in their Churches at this preſent. The third is that which was lately printed in the yeare 1600. vvhich as I imagine is the ſelfe ſame vvith that vvhich vvas printed not long before in the yeare 1589. and 1592. let vs nowe come to ſee a fewe of their corruptions.</p>

                  <p>FIRST, to improue the <hi>ſupreme authority of the Church,</hi> they ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the vvord <hi>Church</hi> cleane out of their Bible printed in the yeare 1562. and in place of it vſed the vvord <hi>congregation;</hi> but in the later editions, ſince that they began to haue a certaine forme of a Church, this fault is amended.</p>

                     <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> telleth vs, that <hi>Heretikes</hi> to defend their peruerſe and erroneous doctrine, are wont to detruncate, and by falſe expoſitions, to peruert holy Scriptures. And no maruaile that <hi>Heretikes</hi> haue alwaies runne this courſe, for howe can falſhood being of no force or ſtrength, be defended and maintained but by cunning deuiſes, deceits, and lies? truth being of it ſelfe inuincible needeth no ſuch deceitful helpe. This moued <hi>S. Paul</hi> of himſelfe and other preachers of truth, to vſe theſe wordes:<note n="c" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2, 17.</note> 
                     <hi>We are not as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many adultering the word of God, but of ſincerity: and as of God, before God we ſpeake.</hi> And againe: <hi>We renounce the ſecret thinges of diſhone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, not walking in craftineſſe not adultering the word of God:</hi> contrary to this are al the proceedings of the patrons of falſhood.</p>
                  <p>But let vs now gather two briefe concluſions out of the long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of this Chapter: Of vvhich the firſt ſhal be, that the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie betweene vs and our aduerſaries is not touching the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Scriptures themſelues, but touching the tranſlation and interpretation of the ſame. This is manifeſt, becauſe vve doe not reject the places of Scripture by them corrupted and falſified, as they are in the <hi>Hebrewe, Greeke,</hi> or vulgar <hi>Latin:</hi> but we argue their tranſlation and interpretation of the ſaid places of corruption and falſhood; and conſequently, cenſure it to be the word of man, not the vvord of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I inferre, that our aduerſaries tranſlated Bibles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine not the true vvord of God: and conſequently, that although vve ſhould grant vnto them, that the bare letter of Scripture is a ſufficient ground of Chriſtian faith and religion; yet that they building vpon their ſaid Bibles, haue not this ground or founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <hi>SECTION THE SECOND.</hi> The ſame argument is confirmed by the teſtimonie of ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, concerning the true ſenſe of ſome wordes of Scripture, alleaged for our Catholike doctrine touching juſtification in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction before.</head>
                  <p>NOTVVITHSTANDING the wordes af Scripture cited for vs <hi>Catholikes</hi> are moſt plaine, yet it may be ſome follower of the new religion wil imagine, that we wreſt them to a ſenſe improper, and in the primatiue ages of the Church vnheard off; contrariwiſe, that thoſe of his beliefe deliuer the true, literal and auncient expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the ſame.

                     <hi>Wolfangus Muſculus</hi> a <hi>Zwinglian</hi> hauing reprehended <hi>S.

I ſhal recite his words more at large in the next chapter. And what greater proofe then the aſſertion of ſo many of his learned Maſters, can a reaſonable man of the newe religion require? Behold both learned <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> with their firſt beginner <hi>Luther,</hi> and a principal <hi>Sacramentarie</hi> confeſſe, that we follow the true and litteral ſenſe of <hi>S.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19127:150"/>
the <hi>Church of England</hi> vvith <hi>Caluin</hi> and the <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Zwinglians,</hi> admit it as Canonical; and therefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the doctrine of the followers of the newe religion, we may very vvel frame this argument: The Epiſtle of <hi>S. Iames</hi> is Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Scripture; but the Epiſtle of <hi>S. Iames</hi> approueth juſtification by good vvorkes, and ſaith it is not wrought by faith only; therefore the Canonical Scripture approueth juſtification by good vvorkes, and ſaith it is not wrought by faith only. The firſt propoſition is affirmed true as is afore ſaid, by the <hi>Church of England,</hi> by <hi>Caluin</hi> and al his <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> and by moſt of the <hi>Zwinglians;</hi> the ſecond by al the <hi>Lutherans:</hi> of which the concluſion neceſſarily followeth, and conſequently our doctrine touching juſtification, according to the teſtimony of our aduerſaries, is built vpon the letter of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Which prerogatiue if it be truly yeelded vnto vs, it muſt needes be denied vnto them; for the Scriptures teach not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and it is in no place oppoſite to it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it may be replied and ſaid, that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> doe not vvel vnderſtand and apprehend <hi>S. Iames</hi> his meaning. This is likewiſe eaſily refelled; for vvhat reaſon hath any indifferent man, to preferre the <hi>Sacramentaries</hi> judgement, before that of the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans.</hi> Doe not theſe vnderſtand the Scriptures as wel as they? what priuilege or vvarrant of not erring haue the <hi>Sacramentaries</hi> aboue the <hi>Lutherans?</hi> In learning without al doubt, and other gifts neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for attaining the true ſenſe of Scripture, theſe were not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to them; yea, <hi>Luther</hi> as I haue related in my <hi>Preface,</hi> is extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily commended euen by thoſe <hi>Sacramentaries,</hi> who otherwiſe expound <hi>S.

                  <p>Neither haue theſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> only thus vnderſtood the holy Scriptures, but alſo as I haue affirmed in the beginning of this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the auncient Fathers. And this I vvil alſo proue, by the like teſtimonies and confeſſion of our aduerſaries. The <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> or <hi>Century writers</hi> are much commended by al ſorts of followers of the newe religion, for their diligence vſed and paines taken, both in peruſing and cenſuring al Councels and old Authours, and alſo in penning of their Eccleſiaſtical hiſtorie, eſpecially of the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church: Let theſe men therefore declare and tel vs, vvhat the auncient Fathers beleeued and taught touching juſtification. Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ſo great and ſo principal antiquaries, being themſelues of a contrary beliefe affirme that the ſaid Fathers haue erred in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle by aſcribing juſtification to good vvorkes, and denying it to only faith. For of the ſecond age after Chriſt thus they vvrite: <hi>The doctrine of juſtification was deliuered more negligently and obſcurely,</hi>

                  <p>Some <hi>Sacramentarie</hi> followers of the newe religion imagine and thinke, that <hi>Caluin</hi> and his diſciples deny not the real preſence of Chriſtes body and bloud in the ſacrament, and therefore they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch vnto the <hi>Caluinian</hi> communion with great reuerence, dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming themſelues truly and reallie to receiue in it, the ſaid body and bloud of our Lord: where-vpon they inferre, that their beliefe touching this point, is as conformable to the letter of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as ours.

                     <hi>Andrew Willet</hi> before cited, in expreſſe wordes auoucheth and concludeth, that <hi>looke howe the word of God worketh being preached, ſo doe the Sacraments.</hi> Their doctrine therefore is, that Chriſt may as truly and really be receiued by hearing of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as he is in their ſupper. And of al this I may firſt inferre, that if they ſay true vve may as truely and really receiue Chriſt in our chambers reading the Scriptures, and by feeding on him by faith, or by eating a peece of bakers bread and drinking a cup of wine, or by taking any other ſuch corporal foode in remembrance that he died for vs on the Croſſe; as we can doe in their Churches by taking the like bread and vvine of the Miniſter. I further inferre that the opinion of <hi>Carolostadius, Zwinglius,</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> in verie
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19127:159"/>
deede, equally exclude Chriſt from being really preſent in the Euchariſt: and therefore the bread and vvine vvhich they receiue according to al their judgements, is nothing better then a peece of bakers bread, or a bottle of wine bought in a tauerne. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is euident, becauſe Chriſt himſelfe according to his humane nature, is as far diſtant from the bread and wine as heauen is from earth: &amp; although <hi>Caluin</hi> acknoweledg a certaine vnion betweene vs and Chriſt by faith, yet this is a thing altogether extrinſecal to the bread and wine, for this faith is in the ſoule not in the bread and vvine: neither doth it vnite the body and bloud of Chriſt to the bread and vvine, but (as they ſay) to the ſoule. And this vnion in like ſort is not real but imaginary; for the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt are as farre diſtant from our faith (vvhich is an inward act of our ſoule, and produceth of it ſelfe no outward effect;) as they are from the bread and wine. And this is true, euen according to the doctrine of <hi>Caluin</hi> and his diſciples, vvhatſoeuer they ſeeme in vvordes to ſay to the contrary. But to make the proofe of it more ſtrong, let vs confirme it by the teſtimony of <hi>Beza,</hi>

his readers, and to abuſe them more pernitiouſly. For ſeing that the vvordes of Scripture are ſo euident for the real preſence of Chriſtes body and bloud in this Sacrament; ſeing alſo that al our forefathers and predeceſſors haue eſteemed it ſo highly, haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo honourable of it, and haue expounded the Scriptures accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their plaine meaning, if <hi>Caluin</hi> had in flat tearmes &amp; wordes ſo much debaſed it, as to make it no better then a peece of bakers bread, and a cuppe of wine, he had made forthwith his doctrine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to al indifferent Chriſtians. And of this he ſawe an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in <hi>Zwinglius</hi> before him, againſt vvhoſe prophane doctrine both the <hi>Catholikes</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> vvith one voice exclaimed.

Of vvhich I inferre, firſt that <hi>Caluin</hi> and his followers cal God a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer. For thus I argue: <hi>Vnleſſe a man wil cal God a deceiuer, he can neuer be ſo bold as to ſay that he ſetteh before vs an empty or naked ſigne in the ſupper</hi> (ſo ſaith <hi>Caluin</hi> before cited:) but <hi>Caluin</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers are ſo bold as to ſay, that <hi>God ſetteth before vs an empty or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſigne in the ſupper,</hi> as is proued by their owne vvordes, by the teſtimony of <hi>Beza,</hi> and the cenſure of ſome learned <hi>Lutheran Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants;</hi> therefore <hi>Caluin</hi> and his followers <hi>cal God a deceiuer.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly I inferre, that the <hi>Caluinian Sacrament</hi> or <hi>ſupper,</hi> is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a <hi>peece of bakers bread</hi> and <hi>cup of ordinary wine;</hi> this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated and it is apparant, becauſe Chriſt (as they ſay) is no otherwiſe preſent but by the apprehenſion of faith, and faith hath no effect at al in the bread &amp; wine, it being an inward act of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: whererfore the bread and wine remaine as they were before. And this <hi>Luther</hi> long ſince concluded againſt <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> from vvhome <hi>Caluin</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> confeſſeth doth not diſſent: for he complaineth that <hi>the Deuil</hi> (by <hi>Zwinglius</hi> and his adherents) <hi>labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to ſuppe vp the egge and leaue vs the ſhel,</hi>

                  <p>Thus I haue exemplified and ſhewed in two principal contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies, by the teſtimonies of our aduerſaries, that the vvordes of holy Scripture are on our ſide, not with our aduerſaries: Of which my prudent reader may gather, what I could doe concerning other matters for breuities ſake omitted.

                  <p>MY drift and intent in this Chapter is to ſhewe, that our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries build not their beliefe vpon the letter of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, contained (as they ſay) in their owne Bibles. This I haue already proued by one argument, vnto vvhich I adjoine another euen of as great force, to wit: that in diuers points they obſerue not the letter of holy Scripture contained in their owne Bibles. I vvil exemplifie in ſome matters in particular.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, if the letter of holy Scripture be ſo ſtrictly to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, and al other groundes to be neglected, as they imagine; howe dare they eate bloud and ſtrangled meates? Is not this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbidden in the Acts of the Apoſtles by the whole Councel of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi>

                  <p>But before I bring forth any one reaſon, I muſt here diuide al the Profeſſours of the newe religion into three ſorts or companies: for ſome of them read and vnderſtand the Scriptures in thoſe tongues, in vvhich they were firſt penned by the inſtinct of the holy Ghoſt; others there be that reade and vnderſtand them only tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other tongues; and others that cannot reade at al.

In the foure firſt Sections I wil principally diſcourſe of the learned. And firſt I demand of them howe they proue the Bible to be Canonical Scripture? verily this as I haue ſhewed before, cannot be proued by Canonical Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, neither haue they for it as I haue there alſo declared, any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infallible proofe: vvherefore I may truly auouch, that euery one of them receiueth and rejecteth Scripture according as he is led by his owne fancy.

                     <hi>but he whatſoeuer he was, though he speake otherwiſe then</hi> S.

Iames: Wherefore he</hi> (Iames) <hi>alleageth the example of</hi> Abraham <hi>nothing to the purpoſe, where he ſaith; wilt thou knowe O vaine man, that faith without workes is dead?</hi> Abraham <hi>our father was he not juſtified by workes when he offered his ſonne</hi> Iſaac? <hi>He confoundeth the word faith. Howe much better had it beene for him, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently and plainely to haue diſtinguiſhed the true and properly Chriſtian faith which the Apoſtle euer preached, from that which is common to</hi> Iewes <hi>and</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>Turkes and</hi> Diuels; <hi>then to confound them both, and ſet downe his ſentence ſo different from the Apoſtolical doctrine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as concluding he ſaith: You ſee that a man is juſtified by workes, and not by faith alone; whereas the Apoſtle out of the ſame place diſputeth thus, &amp;c.</hi> And hauing made <hi>S.

This and other more ſuch ſtuffe hath this <hi>Sacramentary</hi> Doctor againſt <hi>S. Iames</hi> and his Epiſtle, in which he diſſenteth from moſt of his owne company. Doth not alſo <hi>Beza</hi> reject, or at the leaſt doubt of the truth of the whole hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the adoulterous woman, recorded by <hi>S.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:19127:165"/>
of his new Teſtament in the end of the eight chapter of <hi>S.

And theſe thinges in like ſort manifeſtly conuince, that the <hi>Sacramentaries</hi> in admitting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting bookes of Scripture, are led by their owne judgement and fancy, not by any diuine or infallible rule.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, diuers parcels of holy Scripture (as I haue declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue) haue bin in times paſt of doubtful authority; of which moſt of our aduerſaries haue receiued ſome into the Canon, and rejected others. For example, our <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> haue receiued the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> and the <hi>Apocalipſe,</hi> and rejected the books of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> of <hi>Iudith, Tobias, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe the authority of theſe in the primatiue Church was called in queſtion. But what reaſon haue they for this fact? haue they had any diuine teſtimony or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation commanding them to admit the firſt? Surely none, ſeing that they contemne the authority of the Church. And wherefore receiued they not the laſt, aſwel as the firſt? They vvil ſay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that the firſt vvere admitted by diuers euen in the primatiue Church, and doubted off only by ſome. I reply, that <hi>Brentius</hi> hauing named and numbred al of both ſorts of them in general, writeth thus:<note place="margin">Brentius in Apolog. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs. Wittenb.</note> 
                     <hi>There are ſome of the auncient Fathers who receiue theſe Apocriphal bookes into the number of Canonical Scriptures: and in like ſort ſome Councels command them to be acknowledge as Canonical.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in my judgement, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon vvhy they rejected and reject thoſe of the old Teſtament is, becauſe in ſome points they contrary their newe doctrine, which they made and make a rule whereby to diſcerne which bookes are Canonical. Hence they receiued thoſe which they could make in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:19127:166"/>
outward ſhewe ſeeme to fauour their opinion, and rejected others: and this is the cauſe why <hi>Luther</hi> rejecteth more bookes then the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sectaries. For he being the firſt that beganne to preach this newe Goſpel, could not preſently forge and inuent newe gloſſes and interpretations, vpon al the bookes of Scripture that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelues againſt the ſame: vvherefore he rejected ſundry ſuch bookes, vvhich afterwardes his followers hauing inuented ſuch gloſſes and interpretations, receiued.

                     </note> who moſt eſpecially and moſt earneſtly teach, that only faith without workes doth juſtifie and ſaue vs: of which he inferreth, that <hi>S.

Luke.</hi> His diſciples the <hi>Centuria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores</hi> likewiſe yeeld this reaſon, vvherefore the epiſtle of <hi>S. Iames</hi> is to be rejected; that in the ſecond chapter he affirmeth that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> vvas not juſtified by faith only,<note place="margin">Zwinglius in explanat. art <hi>57.</hi> tom. <hi>2.</hi> fol. <hi>100.</hi>
                     </note> but by workes. <hi>Zwinglius</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo affirmeth, that although the ſecond booke of the <hi>Machabees</hi> were in the Canon, yet that the authour of it maketh himſelfe ſuſpected by this, that writing an hiſtory he doth ſet downe a point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning praier for the dead. By which it is manifeſt, that they meaſure Canonical Scripture by their faith, not their faith by Canonical Scripture.</p>
                  <p>But to reject thoſe bookes of Scripture vvhich made againſt them, was an old deuiſe among the auncient <hi>Heretikes,</hi> vnto whome our aduerſaries in this alſo as in other things, conforme themſelues. For this fault <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> noted in <hi>Faustus</hi> a <hi>Maenichee,</hi> and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth it in him after this ſort: <hi>Whereas thou ſaieſt this is Scripture, or this is ſuch an Apoſtles;</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>this is not, becauſe this ſtandeth forme, and the other againſt me. Thou then art the rule of faith, whatſoeuer is againſt thee is not true:</hi> Hitherto <hi>S. Auguſtine. Tertullian</hi> in like manner and <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> record, that euen in their daies <hi>Heretikes</hi> rejected cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine bookes of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Vnto this their rejecting and admitting of Scripture according to their owne fancy, I adde alſo that out of their owne judgement vvithout any further vvarrant, they alter or (as they ſay) correct the text. For example, although they eſteeme the <hi>Greeke</hi> text of the newe teſtament aboue al others, yet <hi>Beza</hi> in his tranſlation of the ſame (as it is noted before) doth willingly and wittingly thruſt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:19127:166"/>
out of it thoſe vvordes (<hi>Luke</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 36) <hi>who was of Cainan.</hi> Of the ſame fault I accuſe alſo our <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> in their Bible of the yeare 1595. And this they doe, notwithſtanding that al <hi>Greeke</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies both of the old Teſtament in the booke of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and of the newe; and al the <hi>Latin</hi> of the newe conſpire againſt them. If they anſwere that the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> of the old accordeth with them; I reply that al the Scripture was penned by the inſtinct of the holy Ghoſt, and conſequently is true: wherefore, if ſomething more be ſaid in one thing more then is in another, the one is not to be corrected or altered by the other, for both may be very vvel conſonant vnto truth. Moreouer, vvil theſe men ſay that the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> of the old teſtament is ſo true and ſincere, that it ſelfe needeth no correction? vvhat warrant haue they more for the ſincerity of this, then for the <hi>Greeke</hi> of the newe. If it be ſo ſincere, and they haue any ſuch war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; wherefore doe they alſo correct and forſake it in their tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? That they doe this, it appeareth by their tranſlation of the 17. <hi>verſ.</hi> of the 22. <hi>pſalme,</hi> vvhere they reade:<note place="margin">

                  <p>This therefore being preſuppoſed, that diuers ſentences admit diuers tranſlations, let the newe ſectary nowe tel me, what diuine authority he hath mouing him rather to followe one ſenſe then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, the vvordes receiuing and ſometimes being indifferent to both? Euery priuate mans vnderſtanding is ſubject to errour, and there is but one truth; howe then doth euery one of them knowe that truth is on his ſide? vvhat diuine authority doth warrant him this?

                     </note> And note vvel that he preferreth his owne priuate ſpirit (for the holy Ghoſt as I haue proued, infallibly directeth not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry priuate mans judgement) before the teſtimony of al other men, and plainely confeſſeth that he buildeth vpon it, not vpon the vvord of God. This alſo moued the tranſlatour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble printed in the yeare 1589. 1592. and 1600. to proteſt in his preface, that in the tranſlating of it, he <hi>hath in euery point and word according to the meaſure of his knowledge, faithfully rendred the text; and in al hard places most ſincerely expounded</hi> the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But to make this the more euident I adde further, that they make the ſelfe ſame vvord ſometimes to ſignifie one thing, and at other times another thing, as it beſt ſerueth their purpoſe. For example, our <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> whenſoeuer the Scripture ſpeaketh of euil traditions, as <hi>Math.</hi> 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. and in other places,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bible</hi> 1595.</note> tranſlate the <hi>Greeke</hi> vvord vvhich ſignifieth properly a <hi>tradition,</hi> truly as they ought. But when mention is of <hi>Apoſtolike traditions,</hi> they make the ſelfe ſame <hi>Greeke</hi> vvord ſignifie <hi>ordinances, inſtructions,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bible</hi> 1595.</note>

But of ſuch examples ſee more in the ſixt Chapter before. Beſides this, although they vndertake to tranſlate the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> text of the old teſtament, and the <hi>Greeke</hi> of the newe; yet vvhen the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> or <hi>Greeke</hi> maketh againſt them, or not ſo much for them as the <hi>Latin,</hi> they forſake the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> and <hi>Greeke,</hi> and followe the <hi>Latin:</hi> I vvil bring an example of both. <hi>Hieremy</hi> 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. and <hi>chap.</hi> 44. <hi>ver.</hi> 19. the ſaid Prophet inueigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt thoſe that offer ſacrifice to ſtrange Gods, eſpecially to the <hi>Moone.</hi> And whereas according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> they ſhould read in the firſt place, <hi>The women kneade the dowe to make cakes to offer to the heauens or planets:</hi> they followe the <hi>Latin</hi> and ſay thus:<note place="margin">

                     <hi>The women kneade the dowe to make cakes for the Queene of heauen.</hi> In like ſort they proceede in the ſecond place. And by this meanes as they imagine, they make a ſtrong argument againſt vs, vvho honour our bleſſed Lady and cal her Queene of heauen, although we offer vp no ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vnto her or any other creature. In the newe teſtament whereas the Apoſtle according to the <hi>Greeke</hi> text ſaith only:<note place="margin">

And like as after this ſort they ſerue their owne turnes in their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations, ſo doe they alſo in their expoſitions of diuers wordes. One example I haue touched aboue concerning the vvord <hi>Babilon,</hi> which in <hi>S. Peters</hi> epiſtle to hinder the proofe of the ſaid Apoſtles being at <hi>Rome,</hi>

                     <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calipſe</hi> they affirme the City of <hi>Rome</hi> by it to be vnderſtood.</p>
                  <p>Let vs alſo conſider that it muſt needes be granted, that ſome of the learned ſectaries haue erred in their tranſlations and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of holy Scripture; for this is euident, becauſe there is but one true vvord of God, which according to truth admitteth not oppoſite interpretations. But our aduerſaries tranſlations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations be diuers and much different, yea repugnant one to another: wherefore as I haue ſhewed, they reject one anothers tranſlation and interpretation, and alſo alleage Scripture for their different doctrine. They cannot therefore al be conſonant to the true word of God; vvhich if it be confeſſed, it muſt needes follow that ſome of them in theſe matters haue erred; and if ſome of them haue erred, then ſome of them (without al doubt) haue not built vpon diuine authority which cannot be the ground of errour, but vpon their owne judgement. And ſeing that the warrant which they claime from God, of al of them is the ſame, and their ground alike; we may wel inferre, that none of them build vpon any other more ſure foundation.</p>
                  <p>Adde vnto this, that the ſelfe ſame ſectaries oftentimes vpon further reading, ſtudy, and knowledge, change their tranſlations and interpretations of holy Scripture; vvhich is apparent by the diuers editions of the Bibles, and other their workes in which Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is alleaged and interpreted: and of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſectaries it is granted by the tranſlatour of the Bible printed in the yeare 1585. 1592. and 1600. in the preface of which he confeſſeth, that the <hi>former tranſlations required greatly to be peruſed, and reformed.</hi> I haue alſo ſhewed in the ſixt chapter, that diuers places haue beene corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and that as yet by the judgement of the beſt, it is faulty: of this followeth not ſeldome, a change of belief and a difference from themſelues in religion, vvhich in the next chapter I vvil proue to haue fallen out in their firſt Captaines themſelues. And this is an
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:19127:168"/>
inuincible argument (ſeing that the Scriptures remaine alwaies the ſelfe ſame) to proue, that they varying build only vpon their owne fancies, and are neuer certaine that they haue attained to the truth.</p>
                  <p>But this vvil be moſt apparent to him, that ſhal ſet before his eies the manner of proceeding of our ſaid learned ſectaries, in their diſcourſes or diſputations vvith their aduerſaries. For doe they in ſuch conferences admit the text of holy Scripture, as a ſupreame judge of al controuerſies concerning matters of religion? Surely no: for although they ſeeme to recurre to the holy Scripture and vehemently pleade the word of God, and by the authority thereof ſhewe themſelues deſirous to haue al difficulties decided; yet in very truth it is not ſo, as euery man may vvel judge, becauſe the letter of Scripture oftentimes doth not ſufficiently interpret it ſelfe, and they wil admit and allowe of no other tranſlation or interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but their owne: let vs declare this a litle more at large. It is not vnknowne that the <hi>Catholikes</hi> receiue as Canonical, the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> text as wel as they; and conſequently thoſe very places, either in <hi>Hebrewe, Greeke,</hi> or both, vvhich they alleage to eſtabliſh their doctrine oppoſite to the beliefe of the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church. Yea, the <hi>Catholikes</hi> attribute more authority to the places alleaged as they are penned in the ſaid tongues, and to al bookes vvhich the newe ſectaries receiue, then they doe; and further receiue fiue whole bookes at the leaſt, and diuers other parcels of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture into the Canon, which they al commonly reject. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the controuerſie is not concerning the authority of the text, either in <hi>Hebrewe</hi> or <hi>Greeke,</hi> whither it be to be beleeued or no: but vvhither the <hi>Catholikes</hi> building in this vpon the authority of the Church, Traditions, Councels, and Fathers, haue the true tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and expoſition of the text; or the Profeſſours of the newe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, vvho alleage no other teſtimony for themſelues then their owne priuate ſpirit and fancy.</p>
                  <p>To make this more euident by an example, let vs ſuppoſe that a <hi>Catholike</hi> and a newe Sectary fal into diſputation concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſts diſcent into hel. The <hi>Catholike</hi> vſually for proofe of the affirmatiue part, bringeth forth that ſentence of holie Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: <hi>Thou wilt not leaue my ſoule in hel;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15, 10.</note> and auoucheth this to be the true tranſlation of thoſe wordes, eſpecially in this ſentence in which they can beare no other ſenſe, ſeing that the ſoule of Chriſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19127:169"/>
was not detained in his graue. The Sectary contrariwiſe affirmeth the vvordes cited not to be truely tranſlated, but wil haue the true tranſlation of them to be:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bible</hi> 1589. 1592. 1600.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou wilt not leaue my ſoule in graue.</hi> And howe ſhal this controuerſie be decided? The <hi>Catholike</hi> for his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and to proue that Chriſt truely deſcended into hel, alleageth al the grounds of <hi>Catholike</hi> faith aboue ſet downe. But what can his aduerſary bring forth in defence of his doctrine? Perhaps he wil runne to conference of other places of Scripture: but what if thoſe other places admit alſo diuers tranſlations as wel as this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he giue one ſenſe of the ſaid places, and the <hi>Catholike</hi> another? To what other judge wil the Sectary appeale? verily to no other but to himſelfe and his owne priuate judgement. This is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of proceeding of our aduerſaries with vs, and al others that doe impugne them. And doe they in this caſe remit the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie to holy Scripture? doe not the <hi>Catholikes</hi> aſwel as they, admit of the text cited both as it is found in the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> in the 15. pſalme; and alſo as it is in the <hi>Greeke</hi> in the ſecond Chapter of the Acts of the Apoſtles? this cannot be denied. The difference then betweene vs &amp; them, is concerning the tranſlation of the laſt word which the <hi>Catholike</hi> affirmeth to ſignifie hel, the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> graue. And what moueth the Sectary to admit one tranſlation rather then another?

                     <hi>Luther</hi> hath recorded, that in his daies there vvere among the <hi>Sacramentaries,</hi> about tenne diuers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of them; and in the yeare 1577. a booke vvas pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, in vvhich two hundred expoſitions or deprauations of the ſaid vvordes are numbred and aſſigned, al inuented or reuiued by the Profeſſours of this newe religion. Nowe I thinke, that no man indued with any ſenſe or reaſon wil be ſo fond, as to affirme that al theſe expoſitions haue a certaine ground in the word of God: for certaine it is (as we haue hard <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe confeſſe) that there is but one true ſenſe of theſe vvordes; vvherefore it muſt needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe that al the reſt be falſe and forged.

What rules and helps are then aſſigned by him let vs recite, and for auoiding of repetition togither confute them:<note place="margin">Ibid. chap. <hi>19</hi>
                     </note> theſe are his vvordes. <hi>Touching the rules we are to followe, the helps we are to truſt vnto, and the thinges required in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Scripture, I thinke we may thus reſolue. First, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired an illumination of the vnderſtanding, for the natural man perceiueth not the thinges of God, for they are ſpiritually diſcerned; but the ſpiritual man judgeth al thinges, and himſelfe is judged of none.</hi> This is the firſt helpe, concerning which I firſt demand; howe a man ſhal infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly knowe that he hath ſuch an illumination, or that he is a ſpiritual man? if he anſwere that it is knowne by this, that a man feeleth himſelfe thus and thus affected: I vrge further and aske, by vvhat diuine teſtimony or firme reaſon he knoweth, that a man feeling himſelfe ſo affected, hath an illumination of the vnderſtanding from God, and is a ſpiritual man? verily, ſeing that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi> both boaſted of ſuch an illumination, and yet one of them was deceiued:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 14</note> ſeing alſo that the Diuel doth often <hi>transfigure himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Angel of light,</hi> as <hi>S. Paul</hi> vvarneth vs, and as our aduerſaries vvil grant it hapneth to the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and others: ſeing moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>1.</hi> Iohn <hi>4.</hi> v. <hi>1.</hi> Caluin allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the <hi>8.</hi> ſection of this chapter.</note> that the Apoſtle <hi>S. Iohn</hi> biddeth vs not <hi>beleeue euery ſpirit, but proue the ſpirits if they be of God,</hi> vvhich <hi>Caluin</hi> alſo thinketh neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; he muſt alleage or knowe ſome ſuch teſtimony or reaſon, or elſe he cannot ordinarily haue ſupernatural knowledge of it: which neuertheleſſe at the leaſt is neceſſarily required to this, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the place of Scripture expounded, be an inducement
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:19127:171"/>
or ground of ſupernatural faith. And vvhat diuine teſtimony can he alleage? no other I thinke but Scripture, or diuine inſpiration: if Scripture, then another queſtion may be asked, howe he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe rightly to vnderſtand that place of Scripture? if inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I demand in like ſort, howe he knoweth it to be diuine and not diabolical? and ſo of both theſe anſweres wil follow a proceſſe without end. Secondly, of this rule it may be inferred, not only againſt <hi>Field,</hi> but al our aduerſaries that our faith is not built vpon only Scripture, for a man (as <hi>Field</hi> ſaith) muſt be ſpiritual before he can vnderſtand the Scripture: and howe ſpiritual vvithout faith? and vvhereupon ſhal this faith be built? vpon the Scripture? this cannot be, becauſe without it he cannot vnderſtand the Scripture: and howe can he build his faith vpon Scripture before he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth it; of which it followeth (as I haue ſaid) that the Scripture is not the firſt and only rule of our faith, as they affirme. Neither can it be auerred, that the firſt faith is not properly faith; for as they confeſſe it maketh a man ſpiritual, and is the ground of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the true ſenſe of Scripture, and conſequently muſt be a true faith, and properly ſo called.</p>
                  <p>Secondly <hi>Field</hi> requireth, <hi>a minde free from the thought of other thinges, depending on God as the fountaine of illumination, deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>s of the truth, with reſolution to imbrace it, though contrary to the conceit of natural men.</hi> But firſt this alſo ſeemeth to preſuppoſe faith and grace: yea ſome extraordinary perfection, more then is ordinarily found in the greater part of Chriſtians. Secondly, I diſlike thoſe his vvordes <hi>(deſirous of the truth with reſolution to imbrace it)</hi> if they be vnderſtood of matters of faith; for they ſeeme to pretend a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinde of doubt and ſtaggering, vvhich muſt not be allowed in ſuch points, eſpecially in ſpiritual men as before.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he thinketh the <hi>knowledge of the rule of faith formerly ſet downe, neceſſary; as alſo of the practiſe of the Saints according to the ſame.</hi> Of this his rule of faith formerly by him ſet downe, <hi>booke</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 4. I haue ſaid ſomething before:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Part.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.</note> As touching this his preſent doctrine it is certaine, that moſt men wil not allow of his ſaid rule, but either vvil condemne it as inſufficient, in not conteining al thinges neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: or as ouer-large in containing thinges ſuperfluous: vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this his third rule in this part is very vncertaine. But in very deede, that the Scriptures ought to be interpreted according to the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:19127:172"/>
rule of faith, that is: the whole ſumme of Chriſtian religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued as a <hi>Depoſitum</hi> in the Church,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 7. <hi>ſect.</hi> 5.</note> I haue proued in the firſt part of this Treatiſe. Moreouer, as before I argued againſt the firſt rules, ſo I argue againſt this; that of it may be inferred, that our faith is not built vpon the holy Scripture, becauſe the rule of faith muſt be a rule by vvhich the ſcriptures are to be expounded: of which it followeth, that it ſelfe is not knowne and belieued through the authority of the ſcripture. Againſt the ſecond part of this rule I oppoſe only,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Part.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.</note> that according to his groundes of which I haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed before, the practiſe of the Saints can very hardly be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the monuments of antiquity, eſpecially concerning ſuch matters as <hi>Field</hi> denieth to be of the ſubſtance of our faith: vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this alſo maketh euery expoſition of ſcripture obſcure, and of an vncertaine truth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, is required (ſaith he) <hi>a due conſideration, what wil followe vpon our interpretation, agreing with, or contrary to the thinges generally receiued and beleeued among Chriſtians: in which conſideration the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of other places of Scripture, and the thinges there deliuered is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</hi> To this I ſay firſt; that if <hi>Luther</hi> had wel obſerued this rule, he had neuer broached newe doctrine in the Church. Secondly, the inſufficiency of it is euident,<note place="margin">See before Part. <hi>2.</hi> chap. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> if <hi>Fields</hi> doctrine before ſet downe concerning the errour of almoſt al Chriſtians be true.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly he requireth, <hi>the conſideration of the circumſtances of the places interpreted, the occaſion of the wordes, the thinges going before, and following after.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixtly, he alſo requireth the knowledge of al thoſe <hi>Hiſtories, arts,</hi> and <hi>ſciences which may helpe vs.</hi> Both theſe I let paſſe as neceſſary, yet not as ſufficient to giue vs infallible aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>Seauenthly, he thinketh <hi>the knowledge of the original tongues</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, <hi>and of the phraſes and Idiotiſmes of them.</hi> To which I ſay, that although I thinke this a great helpe, yea abſolutely neceſſary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Protestant</hi> doctrine, becauſe they make the ſcripture the only ground of their faith, and neuertheleſſe haue no diuine meane or prudent reaſon, to aſſure themſelues that any one hath tranſlated them truly; yet it cannot be ſufficient: Neither is it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our <hi>Catholike</hi> proceedings ſo needful: both becauſe vve are ſure that we haue the text truly tranſlated; and alſo, becauſe we make not the ſcripture the propounder of our beliefe, but expound
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19127:172"/>
it according to the rule of faith deliuered and receiued. Theſe are <hi>M. Fields</hi> helps and rules, which he ſetteth downe as a meane where by we may be aſſured that vve haue found out the true meaning of ſcripture. And although euery man may perceiue by that vvhich I haue ſaid againſt ſome of them in particular, howe vveake and doubtful they are; Yet I vvil adde a vvord or two of them in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. And firſt I aske <hi>M. Field,</hi> howe he knoweth theſe his helps and rules to be ſufficient? can he proue their ſufficiency by any diuine teſtimony or infallible argument? nothing leſſe, and therefore I i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that in the beginning he doth not ſo confidently affirme it, but vſeth theſe vvordes: <hi>I thinke we may thus reſolue;</hi> and yet that diuine proofe or at the leaſt ſome forcible reaſon is neceſſary, it can not be denied, becauſe the true interpretation of Scripture is their principal ground of faith, &amp; no interpretation in a matter doubtful, can be infallibly knowne otherwiſe then by the aforeſaid meanes? Are alſo al theſe his helps and rules neceſſary?<note place="margin">See Willet in his Synopſis controuerſ. <hi>1.</hi> quaeſt. <hi>7.</hi> See alſo part. <hi>2.</hi> chap. <hi>5.</hi> ſect. <hi>1.</hi> before.</note> neither this vvil be admitted by his bretheren vvho reject the greater part of them; and he muſt needes in a matter of ſuch importance as this is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their principles, condemne them of great ignorance and errour, if he abſolutely affirme them al neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I gather out of theſe rules, that no man can diuinely or infallibly, aſſure himſelfe of the truth of any other mans expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is manifeſt, becauſe no man can by diuine teſtimony or prudential ground, know that any other man hath ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded according to al theſe rules: nay, what ignorant perſon can ſo knowe the ſufficiency of any learned man, that he is ſufficiently inſtructed in the tongues; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he may embrace his opinion as diuine? Finally, no man can after this ſort aſſuredly knowe, that an other hath an illumination of the vnderſtanding; and that his mind is diſpoſed according to the ſecond rule; which thinges neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Field</hi> vvil haue required, for the attaining of the right vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that appeareth to be very falſe vvhich is auerred by <hi>Field,</hi> to vvit: that a man following ſuch directions as he preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, may not only aſſure himſelfe of the truth of holy Scriptures, but alſo <hi>conuince</hi> the <hi>aduerſaries and gaineſaiers;</hi> for no part of this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion is true. The firſt is ſhewed falſe in my diſcourſe of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular rules, eſpecially by this; that no man can aſſure himſelfe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19127:173"/>
that the hath an illumination of the vnderſtanding: vnto vvhich I here adde, that he cannot likewiſe aſſure himſelfe that he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly obſerued ſuch rules, and that he is euery way ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in minde, and furniſhed with learning according as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; neither can he laſtly proue the ſufficiency of them, as I haue alſo ſhewed. The ſecond part of his aſſertion is much leſſe true: for no man can proue the truth of that to an other, of which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſſured himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I may inferre, that no man who obſerueth not theſe rules hath true faith; and the reaſon is manifeſt, becauſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture thus interpreted (as <hi>Field</hi> ſaith) is the ground of their faith;<note place="margin">Field booke <hi>3</hi> chap. <hi>42.</hi> §. if this kinde.</note> wherefore whoſoeuer expoundeth it otherwiſe, is not faithful. By which I exclude from the number of the faithful (according to this rule) not only ſuch men as are carnal, not ſpiritual; and ſuch as are not diſpoſed in minde according to the ſecond rule: but alſo al per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons vnlearned, vvho haue not the knowledge of ſuch hiſtories, arts, and ſciences, as may helpe, nor of the original tongues, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the two laſt rules. Neither can it be ſaid that ſuch are to learne of others: for as I haue proued in my ſecond illation or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, no man can infallibly aſſure himſelfe that another doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret truly. And this maketh the matter the more doubtful, that commonly what expoſition ſoeuer he followe, he hath more euen of the newe religion it ſelfe againſt him, then vvith him: yea, he may finde the beſt of them erroneous in ſome points, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, hath cauſe to diſtruſt their judgement in others.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly out of this diſcourſe it is euident, that although we ſhould grant this to <hi>M. Field,</hi> that the bare letter of holy Scripture is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently knowne by ſuch meanes, as I haue before related out of him &amp; confuted: yet, the true interpretation being ſo obſcure, and not certainely to be knowne by theſe his rules; it is euident I ſay, that whoſoeuer grounding vpon theſe only embraceth any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation as diuine, buildeth vpon his owne judgement and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not vpon diuine authority. And of this and that vvhich hath already beene ſaid in this chapter and before, I finally inferre; that the vvhole faith of the newe ſectaries is vncertaine, and laſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to their owne judgement and fancy. It is vncertaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they aſſigne no certaine and infallible rule, by vvhich they can aſſuredly knowe the letter or true ſenſe of holie Scripture,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:19127:173"/>
which they make the only ground of their faith: of which (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the judgement of <hi>M. Whitaker</hi> in the like caſe,<note place="margin">Whitaker de Eccleſ. contra Bellar. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſ. <hi>2.</hi> quaeſt. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>3.</hi> pag. <hi>278.</hi>
                     </note> as alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to al reaſon) muſt needes followe an vncertainety of truth in their whole beliefe; that their faith is likewiſe laſtly reſolued to their owne judgement and fancy, it is apparant. For although <hi>Field</hi> tel vs, that<note n="*" place="margin">Field booke <hi>4.</hi> chap. <hi>13.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>the judgement of God the Father, as ſupreame; the judgement of the Sonne, as the eternal word of God; of the ſpirit, as the fountaine of al illumination, making them diſcerne what is true, is that in which they finally reſt.</hi> And that <hi>the judgement or determination of the word of God, is that wherein they reſt, as the rule of their faith; and the light of diuine vnderſtanding, as that whereby they judge of al thinges.</hi> And both he and the reſt ſeeme to reſolue al to the bare letter of holy Scripture: yet it is euident, that their laſt reſolution is not the letter, both becauſe al Chriſtians as wel as they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiue the letter; and conſequently, if the laſt difficulty vvere touching the letter, al vvould eaſily be brought to an agreement. And alſo becauſe as <hi>Field</hi> very vvel noteth out of <hi>S. Hierome:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cha. <hi>18.</hi> ibid. Hieron. in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. ad Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>The Gospel conſiſteth not in the wordes of Scripture, but in the ſenſe and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; not in the outward rinde and skinne, but in the inward path and marrowe; not in the leaues of the wordes, but in the roote and ground of reaſon:</hi> of which it appeareth that the laſt reſolution is to the ſenſe. Seing therefore, that al our aduerſaries in tranſlating and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Scripture, build vpon their owne judgement; it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that in their owne judgement not in the holy Scripture, they ſet vp their laſt reſolution in matters of faith. Neither would they obtaine any other more ſound foundation and ſtronger ſtay, if we ſhould grant that they remit al thinges finally to the letter of holy Scripture: for this alſo they receiue and reject according to their owne fancies, as I haue proued. And in very truth I cannot ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently meruaile, that <hi>M. Field</hi> or any other man of judgement and learning, doth run theſe courſes; I meane impugne our doctrine concerning theſe points, as abſurd and in ſome ſort impoſſible, vvhich in deede is moſt prudent and diuine; and fal into moſt groſſe abſurdities and inconueniences themſelues. For vvhereas according to the firſt opinion aboue related, vve laſtly reſolue our faith into diuine reuelation, vvhereunto we are aided and inclined to giue aſſent by the ſupernatural light of faith, vvhich vvith vs concurreth to euery ſupernatural act of beliefe, vnto vvhich we
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19127:174"/>
are prepared and diſpoſed by moſt prudential motiues and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of credibility. And vvhereas in the firſt act of faith, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the beliefe of a general rule by vvhich we are to be directed, and which we are bound humbly to followe in al particular points of beliefe, and conſequently, for the preſeruation of vnity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of controuerſies, acknowledge one ſupreame, diuine, and definitiue authority on earth: They impugne our aſſertions, and obtrude vnto vs for an only ground of our faith and a directour of our beliefe, the holy Scripture; and giue vs no prudential rules, which may giue a prudent man any aſſured meanes, how to knowe vvhich is the true letter, or which is the true ſenſe of the ſame; Yea, aſſigne ſuch meanes and rules which are proued inſufficient by their owne diſſention concerning theſe very points. And beſides this, that vvhich we vpon ſuch prudential motiues giue to a general au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:<note place="margin">Field booke <hi>4</hi> cap. <hi>13.</hi>

                  <p>IT is moreouer a thing moſt euident, that in the deductions or collections of the articles of their faith and religion out of holy Scripture, they are not only ſubject to errour; but alſo that they followe their owne judgement and inclinations: And this vvil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to any man that ſhal conſider the ſame. One deduction I vvil here ſet downe, vvhich I my ſelfe haue heard ſome of them make, which was this: I vrged them to bring forth ſome authority out of the vvord of God, for their keeping of the Sonday in ſteade of the Saturday? and they alleaged as a ſufficient proof of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thoſe wordes of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in the Apocalipſe:<note place="margin">

Howe doth this followe? <hi>S.

                  <p>I adde alſo for the proofe of this, that their deductions out of the ſelfe ſame wordes, be diuers and oppoſite; for euery ſect like as it hath a particular and proper forme of faith, ſo hath it peculiar and proper deductions out of the text of holy Scripture. This cannot be denied, becauſe the collections of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> Zwinglians, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>Caluinists,</hi> or <hi>Puritans,</hi> Anabaptiſts, <hi>Libertines,</hi> differ from one another, as their beliefe is different.

                  <p>In defence of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> of <hi>Wittenberge,</hi> both concerning the proofe of the letter, and interpretation of holy Scripture, and alſo touching deductions out of the ſame, it may perhaps be ſaid by ſome man,<note place="margin">Harmony of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſs. ſect. <hi>10</hi> pa. <hi>332. 333.</hi> Confeſs.

                  <p>THAT the vnlearned Sectaries be likewiſe in the the ſame caſe, it is farre more eaſie to proue. For beſides that they haue no other meanes to know which bookes are to be receiued as Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Scripture, &amp; which are to be rejected, but the opinion of their learned Maſters, vvho differ among themſelues concerning this matter: of vvhich it followeth, that in following of one and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning others, they followe their owne judgements. Beſides this I ſay it is euident, that they build not their faith and religion vpon the pure word of God, as it vvas firſt penned by the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Ghoſt (for they as I ſuppoſe vnderſtand not the tongues in vvhich it vvas ſo penned) but vpon the vvord of God tranſlated by their learned Captaines.</p>
                  <p>Nowe if their tranſlatours haue erred or may erre in their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations, vvhere is their faith? Surely that they are al ſubject to errour, it is proued before? Howe then can the vnlearned knowe that either through ignorance or malice they haue not erred? what diuine authority or reuelation haue they to perſwade them this, or to propound vnto them their tranſlated Bibles as the true vvord of God? If the ſincerity of the tranſlatour be doubtful, and they haue no ſuch authority or reuelation, howe can they knowe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:19127:177"/>
and infallibly by diuine vvarrant, that their Bibles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the pure and ſincere vvord of God? And if they knowe not this after this ſort, howe can they build vpon their Bibles true faith, vvhich is a moſt certaine knowledge through diuine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation? vvithout al doubt ſeing that they admit no other infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rule, they muſt needes confeſſe that they are alwaies vncertaine vvhether their beliefe be true or no, for their beliefe can haue no further aſſurance of truth, then they haue of the truth of the ground thereof; vvhich they affirme to be the only word of God, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their owne books. Wherefore, ſeing that the truth of theſe is vncertaine, their faith alſo muſt needes be vncertaine. And this argument is ſufficient to proue that the vnlearned ſectaries haue no faith. But I adde further, that I haue before ſet downe diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of holy Scripture, vvhich we affirme in very deede to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by their tranſlations: vvhich our affirmation they may the better beleeue, becauſe they may alſo there ſee, that diuers places in the firſt editions corrupted, are amended in the latter. Howe then can the vnlearned being ignorant in the tongues, diſcerne by the Scripture only whether we ſay true or no? or vvhether we or the authours of their tranſlations erre? Surely, in judging of this controuerſie they followe their owne fancies, neither haue they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſound reaſon (much leſſe diuine authority) that can moue them rather to condemne our tranſlation, then their owne. Hence alſo I infer, that our vnlearned Sectaries are not yet certaine that the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Bibles are the true word of God. This I proue, becauſe they cannot deny but their ſaid bibles were once falſly tranſlated: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe vvherefore haue they beene in ſo many places as I haue noted corrected? Doth not euery correction ſuppoſe a fault? But that they were once falſe, it is granted in the preface to the Bible of the yeare 1589. 1592. and 1600. If they vvere once falſe, howe knowe they that they are nowe true? Had the learned Sectary or Sectaries that laſt amended the Bible, any further vvarrant from God that they ſhould not erre, then they that erred before? vvhat vvarrant had they that erred? no other certainely but their owne knowledge. And vvhat had they that laſt of al corrected it, but the ſame? and ſo the tranſlatour of the aforeſaid Bible in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the reader proteſteth, that <hi>according to the meaſure of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he hath faithfully rendred the text,</hi> and <hi>ſincerely expounded al hard

places;</hi> but who knoweth not, that al theſe mens judgements and knowledges be alike ſubject to errour? If therefore the laſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators or correctors had no further warrant (as they had not) then the former, howe can it certainely be knowne that they haue not alſo erred?<note place="margin">Conference at Hampton-Court, &amp;c.</note> but this likewiſe is confeſſed by the Kings Majeſtie and <hi>D. Reinolds,</hi> as I haue noted before: vvherefore as yet the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſectaries neuer had, nor haue at this preſent a true and certaine ground of their faith; and conſequently, they are yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine vvhither their beliefe be ſound or no, becauſe their Bible on vvhich only they build, containeth not the true vvord of God. Neither wil this be remedied by a new edition of the Bible (which as it is ſaid is nowe in hand) becauſe the newe Tranſlatours vvhich nowe indeauour to correct the old, are alſo ſubject to errour; and therefore the vnlearned ſectaries can neuer certainely knowe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they haue erred or no. Of vvhich I finally inferre, that they can neuer haue true faith, which is a moſt certaine and ſure know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thinges reuealed by God.</p>
                  <p>I vvil adde one other argument moſt euidently conuincing, that none of the vnlearned profeſſours of the newe religion, can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be certaine that their tranſlated Bibles are the true vvord of God, which is this. Euery man muſt needes confeſſe that there is but one true vvord of God: But our aduerſaries Bibles be diuers and differ much one from another (wherefore as I haue ſhewed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man rejecteth al other Bibles, but that which is tranſlated and approued by thoſe of his owne ſect:) therefore al of them but one muſt needes be falſe; vvhich being preſuppoſed, I demand of any one vnlearned ſectary what reaſon he hath to preferre one Bible as true, before al the reſt? for example, vvherefore doth he reject the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> or <hi>Puritan</hi> Bible, and admit that vvhich is authorized to be read in the Churches of <hi>England?</hi> He cannot ſay that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the one agreeth vvith the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> and <hi>Greeke,</hi> and the other doe not; for this he knoweth not, becauſe he is ignorant of thoſe languages. Perhaps he wil ſay that ſome learned men told him ſo; But this is no ſufficient ground, both becauſe if he aske a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> or <hi>Caluinist,</hi> although euen as learned as the <hi>Engliſh Protestant,</hi> they wil tel him the contrary; and alſo, becauſe the judgement of a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, yea of al the learned ſectaries in the world togither, is not ſufficient to make any thing ſo certaine, that vve may vvithout al
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:19127:178"/>
doubt admit it, as a ſufficient ground of an article of faith. For be they neuer ſo learned, yet their ſentence may be erroneous, they themſelues being ſubject to errour: vvherefore the vnlearned ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctary although he make himſelfe judge of al the learned, yet he can not poſſibly moſt aſſuredly knowe, vvhich of them haue erred in tranſlating the Bible. And therefore in accepting and approuing one, and rejecting and condemning the reſt, he buildeth only vpon his owne fancy, vvhich moueth him to accept and approue one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of holy Scripture, before another: either becauſe it fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his owne opinions, or becauſe he hath conceaued a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Tranſlatour, or becauſe the tranſlation is allowed in the Country vvhere he dwelleth, or for ſome other priuate reſpect. Moreouer, although vve ſhould grant to the vnlearned and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſectaries, that they moſt aſſuredly knowe that their tranſlated Bibles are the true vvord of God: yet the interpretations alſo on which they build, yeeld vs euen as forcible an argument as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. For ſeing that the Scriptures are hard and admit diuers inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations (as I haue already proued) yea are ſo diuerſly expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by their learned Captaines, that al their expoſitions cannot be true, who ſeeth not firſt, that the vnlearned and ignorant haue litle reaſon to accept more of one interpretation, then of an other. Secondly, that in accepting one and rejecting others, they build not vpon any diuine authority, but vpon their owne judgement; by vvhich they are moued to thinke the doctrine receiued true, either through the authority of him that teacheth it, or ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of their owne vnderſtanding. Laſtly it is alſo apparant, that in ſo doing they make themſelues judges ouer their Maſters: for vnderſtanding of diuers opinions among them, they chooſe and imbrace one as true, and condemne al others as falſe. But if their learned doctors themſelues, in their interpretations build vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their owne fancies, much more the vnlearned: vvherefore, I need not vſe any long diſcourſe of this matter. Only I wil adde, that it ſeemeth likewiſe neceſſary, that he that vvil build his faith vpon the holy Scriptures, ſhould finde his whole beliefe in the ſaid Scriptures, and knowe perfectly by his owne ſtudie, what articles of faith by them are approued; and conſequently, that he ſhould reade ouer the vvhole Bible, and conferre one place vvith another, leaſt that he be deceiued. Otherwiſe, if he beleeue others concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:19127:178"/>
theſe points, he ſeemeth to build vpon their vvordes, more then vpon the word of God; and to fal into that which by his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren and him, is commonly reprehended as a fault in vs. For they reprehend the vnlearned <hi>Catholikes</hi> that they rely ſo much vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the authority of the Church, and reade not the Scripture them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to knowe what they ought to beleeue; vvhereas, if they doe not as I haue ſaid, they build themſelues vpon the authority of a fewe Miniſters. And theſe reaſons haue more force concerning the ignorant ſectaries that cannot reade, then the vnlearned that can reade, eſpecially this laſt: for the ignorant ſort cannot finde their beliefe by their owne ſtudy in the Bible, and therefore muſt needes rely wholy vpon other mens reports.</p>
                  <p>But our <hi>Engliſh</hi> vnlearned and ignorant <hi>Protestants,</hi> (yea ſome of the learned ſort alſo) recurre to the ſtatutes of the Parliament, and make it as it vvere an infallible judge of al matters of religion. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe I reply, that the Parliament hath no ſuch prerogatiue,<note place="margin">See Bilſon in his treatiſe of the perpetual gouernement of the church cha. <hi>16.</hi> pag. <hi>371. 388. 389.</hi>
                     </note> ſeing it hath neither authority from God, after ſuch ſort to enter-meddle in matters of faith (for this belongeth to the Biſhops and Prelates of the Church) nor a vvarrant from him of not erring: Yea ſeing that it hath erred diuers times, as our <hi>Proteſtants</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues cannot denie, the judgement of it muſt needes be very inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. That they muſt needes grant it to haue erred, I proue; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath now approued ſome articles of faith, which in former times it condemned. This is euident, becauſe ſome of the articles of their beliefe nowe approued, vvere cenſured to be heretical by a Parliament held in the firſt yeare of King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Wiccliffians,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1380. Alſo by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other act of Parliament, in the ſecond yeare of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth. Further their vvhole religion vvas condemned by act of Parliament in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> daies; Yea they cannot deny, but ſome of the chiefe articles of their newe beliefe, were adjudged he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies by a Parliament held in the latter daies of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, euen when he vſed the title of ſupreame head of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by the ſtatute of ſix articles: vpon vvhich diuers of their bretheren were burned, as <hi>Fox</hi> their martir-maker recordeth. Wherefore I may vvel ſay, that their religion hath beene condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as authentically by act of Parliament, as it hath beene appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And what reaſon haue they to beleeue more ſuch Parliaments

                  <p>HAVING proued that the vnlearned and ignorant Sectaries, build their faith and religion vpon their owne fancies; I thinke it not amiſſe to gather out of that which hath beene already ſaid, howe miſerable their eſtate is, and vpon what weake ground they ſtand, and venture the euerlaſting eſtate of their ſoules. For the declaration of this let vs ſuppoſe, that an vnlearned ſectary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doubtful of his faith, commeth to be reſolued to his learned maſters; and let vs behold vvhat groundes of faith are deliuered vnto him, by which he may make a ſtedfaſt and aſſured reſolution; vvhat then is this man perplexed in his beliefe, according to our aduerſaries ordinary manner of proceeding firſt vviſhed to doe? verily firſt; according to their aduiſe he muſt take the Bible into his handes, and diligently viewe what faith is there deliuered and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. But vvhat Bible muſt he take into his handes? no other certainely if he follow their counſaile, but that vvhich is tranſlated and corrupted by thoſe of their owne ſect: not the vvord of God but the vvord of men, as I haue proued before: and this is the firſt ground which he receiueth from them. Suppoſe this be done, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:19127:179"/>
that he being doubtful of this article among others, whither Chriſt be equal and conſubſtantial to his Father or no, turne ouer his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and finde thoſe vvordes of Chriſt; <hi>The father is greater then I:</hi>

                     <hi>I and the father are one,</hi> and pondering vpon it findeth that the Father and the Sonne may be one diuers waies; vvherefore not vnderſtanding of vvhat vnity the ſaid ſentence is meant, ſuppoſe that he remaine yet doubtful and cannot reſolue himſelfe by his Bible: vvhat muſt he doe more? He muſt then (ſay the learned) betake himſelfe to his praiers, and pray vnto God that his ſpirit may by his diuine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, teach him the true ſenſe of the aforeſaid places of ſcripture, and reſolue him of the truth. Wel he doth ſo: After his praiers ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he findeth his minde inclined to one certaine interpretation and opinion, or no: If not then he is yet doubtful. But if he doth finde his minde ſo inclined, is he conſequently ſure that he hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the truth? Howe knoweth he that this inſpiration is from the holy Ghoſt? vvhat reaſon, miracle, reuelation, or infallible vvarrant hath he to aſſure himſelfe of this? vvhere doth he finde that God hath promiſed, that the holy ghoſt ſhal aſſiſt and preſerue euery priuate mans vnderſtanding from errour, that praieth for his aſſiſtance? Howe doth he likewiſe knowe, that his praier is good and acceptable in the ſight of God? verily this is moſt vncertaine; and yet otherwiſe by our praiers we obtaine not our requeſts, and that the holy Ghoſt doth not vſually inſpire euery man that ſo praieth for the truth, it is apparent. For ſuppoſe that an <hi>Engliſh Protestant,</hi> and a <hi>Geneuian Puritan</hi> be at controuerſie touching the ſame ſentence; <hi>I and the father am one,</hi> and after ordinary diſcourſes not agreeing, they betake themſelues both to their praiers, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire God to inſtruct them of the true ſenſe of the ſaid vvordes.

Truly it is impoſſible. And thus the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Sacramentaries,</hi> the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Puritans</hi> with diuers other ſectaries, after many prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vſed on euery ſide, remaine yet at mortal jarres concerning di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers matters in controuerſie betweene them. Neither can it be ſaid, that one part without al doubt is aſſured of the truth; for one hath no more vvarrant for his aſſurance then another; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeing that they cannot be al aſſiſted with diuine inſpiration, vve may wel affirme; that none of them are certaine that they enjoy this prerogatiue, yea vve may very vvel denie it vnto them al: but of this matter I haue treated aboue. For mine intent at this preſent it is ſufficient, that by praier the vnlearned ſectary without ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reuelation or vvarrant from God, which none of them receiue, cannot aſſure himſelfe that his opinion is true. Wherefore let vs yet further ſuppoſe, that he remaine hitherto doubtful, as vpon theſe groundes he ſhould; Is there now any other thing to be done for his better reſolution? If al this (ſay his aduiſers) ſuffice not, he muſt repaire for his better inſtruction to the learned, and aske their counſaile. If he demand whither the learned may not erre in their counſaile, they grant it. If he vrge them, to giue him a certaine and infallible rule whereby to diſcerne in their doctrine, truth from falſhood; they tel him, that when the learned ſpeake according to the vvord of God, they ſay true; otherwiſe, when they ſwarue and ſtray from the ſaid word.<note place="margin">Sutcliffe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wardword encont. <hi>2.</hi> pag. <hi>54.</hi>

Behold therefore this poore perplexed man is ſent back againe to the Scripture. And is not this a palpable circle? Firſt, they ſent him to his Bible, then to conference with one place of Scripture with another; thirdly to his praiers, afterwards to the learned, and nowe to his Bible againe to knowe the true doctrine of the learned from the falſe; neither can they aſſigne any other rule vvhereby this may be knowne. Of vvhich followeth moreouer this abſurdity, that they make him judge ouer the learned; for he is to accept and refuſe their doctrine, according as he judgeth it conſonant or diſſonant from the vvord of God.</p>
                  <p>But let vs ſuppoſe notwithſtanding theſe abſurdities and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, that the vnlearned ſectary for his better inſtruction go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the learned; and comming firſt to an <hi>Engliſh Proteſtant,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth of him the true ſenſe of the ſaid ſentence ſo often alleaged: <hi>I and the father are one.</hi> The <hi>Protestant</hi> telleth him (according to the aſſertion of al the ancient fathers, who by this ſentence commonly refuted the <hi>Arians</hi>) that Chriſt by theſe vvordes giueth vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that he as he is God, and his father haue the very ſelfe ſame ſubſtance.

Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, I cannot ſee what other grounds he can receiue from thoſe Doctors: vvherefore, if he vvil not goe to the piller of truth the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church, which is guided by the holy Ghoſt, and of he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And vvhat a ſlender ground of faith is this? yea, ſeing that he hath no diuine authority vvhereon he buildeth, I may boldly ſay that he hath no faith at al, but only a kinde of opinion.</p>
                  <p>And like as I haue exemplified in this particular controuerſie, ſo could I doe concerning the real preſence, and the true ſenſe of thoſe vvordes; <hi>This is my body,</hi> or any other matter or place of Scripture in queſtion betweene vs, as my reader wil eaſily graunt, for there is the like reaſon of them al: and thus much concerning the vnlearned ſectarie that can reade.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhal we ſay of him that is altogether ignorant and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reade? The learned ſectaries cannot ſend him to their Bible to ſearch out the truth: He cannot likewiſe conferre one place of ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture vvith another; his praiers be of no greater force then his be that can reade; wherefore he hath no other meane left, but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of the learned and his owne judgement: and what wil the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of the learned helpe and auaile him, if he finde among them poſſibility of errour and diſſention? Theſe thinges he cannot but finde, yea, concerning that very text firſt alleaged: <hi>The father is greater then I;</hi> they are at variance; for vvhereas ſome reſtraine it only to the humane nature of Chriſt, <hi>Caluin</hi> ſaith, <hi>He doubteth not to extend it to the whole complexum,</hi>

But vvhat reaſon hath he to accept rather of the word of one miniſter, then of another? For example, what reaſon hath he in the expoſition of thoſe wordes: <hi>This is my body,</hi> rather
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:19127:181"/>
to followe the <hi>Sacramentaries,</hi> then the <hi>Lutherans?</hi> are they not al a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſubject to errors? he cannot ſay that the ſcripture moueth him ſo to doe, becauſe he knoweth the Scripture only by the report of others. Neither hath he any infallible rule whereby to diſcerne the true ſenſe: wherefore, it is his owne fancy which perſwadeth him to accept of the one expoſition, and to reject the other.</p>
                  <p>And doth not alſo this ſectary although altogether vnlearned, take vpon him to judge the learned? Can he poſſibly beleeue the <hi>Sacramentary,</hi> except he judge his doctrine to be true, &amp; condemne al the learned <hi>Lutherans?</hi> Can he follow the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the <hi>Puritans?</hi> &amp;c. verily he cannot. And vvhat a ſimple judge is he, being a man ignorant, voide of learning, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of a ſlender vvit and judgement? And like as euery vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſectary condemneth al the reſt that diſſent from him in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo al the reſt condemne him.

                     <hi>SECTION THE EIGHT.</hi> That the newe ſectaries alleage Scriptures to confirme their newe doctrine, it is no certaine argument that they build their faith and religion vpon the ſaid Scriptures.</head>
                  <p>TO proue that the profeſſors of the newe religion ground their faith and religion vpon the holy Scripture, ſome wil ſay; that they alleage ſentences of the ſaid Scripture in great abundance, in confirmation of their doctrine: vnto whome I anſwere that true it is, that ſo they doe. But I adde, that this is no ſufficient argument to proue that which is intended. And firſt, let euery man deluded by ſuch their proceedings conſider, that al the ancient <hi>Heretikes</hi> haue done the like. Did not <hi>Arius, Macedonius, Neſtorius, Eutiches,</hi> and other <hi>Arch-heretikes</hi> together with their followers, for proofe of their hereſies bring forth diuers places of holy Scripture? Of this <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis</hi> who flouriſhed almoſt twelue hundred yeares ſince,<note place="margin">Vincent. Liri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſ. aduerſ. prophanas haereſum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitates, c. <hi>35.</hi>
                     </note> is a ſufficient witneſſe; for of the ancient <hi>Heretikes</hi> alleaging of the word of God, he writeth thus: <hi>Here perhaps ſome man may demand, whether</hi> Heretikes <hi>alſo doe vſe the teſtimony of holy Scripture? To which I ſay, that they doe, and that very earneſtly; for a man may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them ranging and courſing in euery part of the Bible, in</hi> Moiſes, <hi>in the bookes of the Kinges, in the Pſalmes, in the Apoſtles, in the Goſpels, in the Prophets. For whether they be among their owne brethren, or with ſtrangers; whether in priuate or in publike; whether in talking or in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; whether in the houſe a feasting, or abroade in walking: they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt neuer alleage any thing of their owne, which they doe not pretend to ſhadowe with the ſacred word of Scripture. Reade the pamphlets of Paul as</hi> Sumoſatenus, <hi>of</hi> Priſcillian, <hi>Eunomius,</hi> Iouinian <hi>and the reſt of ſuch like peſtilent</hi> Heretikes, <hi>and you ſhal finde through al their workes an huge heape of examples, almoſt no page omitted, which is not coloured and painted with the ſayings of the old and new Teſtament:</hi> thus farre <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis.</hi>

                     <hi>if they ſeeme in their owne conceit, to affirme that which they ſay out of the chapters of Scripture: whereas the Deuil alſo ſpake ſome thinges out of the Scriptures, and the Scriptures conſist not in the reading, but in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:</hi> Hitherto <hi>S.

by no ſhewe or appearance more faire, then when the word of God is pretended and alleaged: The</hi> Anabaptiſts <hi>againſt whome we nowe write, haue it alwaies in their mouthes, and they alwaies ſolemnely recite it.</hi> And ſoone after hauing deliuered, that the higheſt place is to be giuen to the vvord of God, and that they preſſe it againſt vs. He addeth this exception, or moderation againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſts: But as it is our part to giue eare to thoſe thinges which are ſaid, vntil we knowe of what force or quality euerything is: ſo it is neceſſary that we prudently diſcerne truth and falſhood. And we must juditiouſly conſider, whether the word of God be truly or falſly alleaged vnto vs: for we are commanded to try the ſpirits and to conſider whether they are of God; which howe neceſſary it is, the thing it ſelfe teacheth vs. For the Deuil himſelfe armed himſelfe with the word of God, and girded himſelfe with that ſword, to inuade and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault Christ; and we finde true by experience, that he doth daily vſe theſe guiles or arts by his organs or inſtruments to depraue the truth, and ſo to leade miſerable ſoules to destruction:</hi> Hitherto are <hi>Caluins</hi> vvordes; in which (as we ſee) he is forced to pleade that againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> vvhich vve euen with as good reaſon and as forcibly doe pleade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and al other ſectaries alleaging falſly the Scriptures. Neither doe the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> only cite the ſcriptures plentifully; but alſo the <hi>Arians,</hi> Trinitarians, <hi>Familists,</hi> and other ſuch like whome our aduerſaries commonly cenſure to be <hi>Heretikes.</hi> The like report we haue heard him aboue make of <hi>Weſtphalus</hi> a <hi>Lutheran:</hi> yea there he telleth vs,<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>5.</hi> of this chapter.</note> that <hi>the falſe prophets</hi> in old times, <hi>by howe much the more further they were from God,</hi> by <hi>ſo much the more gloriouſly did pretend his holy name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But did the Deuil or any ancient <hi>Heretike,</hi> or doe the newe ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in theſe our daies, bring forth ſcriptures in their true ſenſe and meaning? God forbid: for the ſcripture confirmeth nothing but truth. They falſly therefore vvreſted and wreſt the ſcripture to a wrong ſenſe, to the end to make it ſeeme to fauour their blaſphea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and vvicked doctrine. Neither can our aduerſaries at this time in excuſe of themſelues truly ſay, that the ancient <hi>Heretikes</hi> alleaged Scripture vvithout any colour or probability of truth, vvhich as they themſelues thinke is not their cuſtome: for this is moſt falſe, as it vvil appeare to any ſchollar that ſhal conſider the proofes of holy Scripture, vvhich ancient <hi>Heretikes</hi> brought for their peſtiferous opinions, and conferre them with the teſtimonies

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſhal likewiſe finde, that in their alleaging the vvord of God, both againſt vs and thoſe of their owne company, they remit not the controuerſie to the bare vvordes of Scripture, but vnto the words of ſcripture tranſlated &amp; expounded by themſelues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they differ in the tranſlation and interpretation of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; for euery one of them rejecteth al other tranſlations &amp; inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations but his owne, vpon vvhich (being his owne fancy) not vpon the Scripture he buildeth his opinion.

                  <p>One example only of his inconſtancy I vvil bring at large, to giue the more credit to the reſt, which ſhalbe touching his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory opinion of freewil; for againſt freewil thus he writeth:<note n="p" place="margin">Luther in aſſert. articul. <hi>36.</hi>

                     <hi>Many ſpeake indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretly of free-wil, wherefore we haue adjoined this briefe information. Man being compelled by lawe and penalties, hath of his owne proper ſtrength free-wil to doe or not to doe external workes; wherefore he may attaine to ſecular or ciuil honesty, and doe good workes of his owne proper ſtrength, giuen and obtained from God to doe theſe thinges. For</hi> Paul <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that juſtice, juſtice of the fleſh: that is to ſay, which the fleſh or man hath of his owne proper ſtrength. So therefore a man worketh of his owne ſtrength ſome juſtice. Verily he hath choice and liberty both to flie euil, and to doe good.</hi> Againe: <hi>The wil of man is in ſuch ſort a free power, that it may doe the justice of the fleſh or ciuil justice, where it is compelled by lawe and force: as not to ſteale, not to kil, not to commit adultery,</hi> &amp;c. Hitherto <hi>Luther</hi> expreſly contradicting his former doctrine. The reaſon as I imagine of this contradiction was, that he ſawe his <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xonian</hi> diſciples by his former opinion growne to al looſeneſſe of life, and abhomination of vice:<note place="margin">Eraſmus in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. ad fratres inferioris Germaniae.</note> wherefore he was forced (as <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmus</hi> recordeth) to ſend viſitours to reduce them from <hi>Paganiſme,</hi> into which they were falling headlong; vnto whome for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter effecting of the matter, he gaue among other inſtructions, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation of his abſolute denial of freewil. Vnto this I could adde his inconſtancy touching the real preſence: for beſides that, he ſometimes allowed of Tranſubſtantiation, and at other times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it affirmed Chriſt to be really preſent, together with bread and vvine; he alſo at the length affirmed the humane nature of Chriſt to be preſent in euery place, together with his God-head: but of <hi>Luther</hi> inough.

                     <hi>or in many ages before;</hi> yet confeſſeth, that <hi>by degrees he ſawe and diſcried thoſe</hi> Popiſh <hi>errours</hi> (I vſe his wordes) <hi>which at first he diſcerned not.</hi> But to excuſe the matter he firſt auoucheth, that <hi>in ſundry points of greatest moment, as of the power of nature, of free-wil, grace, juſtification, the difference of the law and the Gospel, faith, and workes, Chriſtian liberty, and the like, he was euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</hi> Which aſſertion of his howe falſe it is, that which I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid touching <hi>free-wil</hi> doth demonſtrate. An other of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes is, that <hi>it is not ſo ſtrange a thing as his aduerſaries would make it ſeeme to be, that herein</hi> Luther <hi>proceeded by degrees, and in his later wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings diſliked that which in his former he did approue.</hi> And his reaſon is, becauſe <hi>S. Augustine wrote a whole booke of retractations.</hi> S. Ambroſe <hi>complained that he was forced to teach before he had learned, and ſo to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer many thinges that ſhould neede a ſecond reuiewe.</hi> And <hi>S. Thomas</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quine in his ſumme corrected and altered many things which he had written before.</hi> Againſt this I firſt reply, that it excuſeth not <hi>Luthers</hi> building of his new beliefe vpon his owne judgement: nay it proueth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly, that he came not to it by the infallible direction of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal guide, but by the diſcourſe and ſearch of his owne wit; and moreouer,<note place="margin">Caluin Inſtit. booke <hi>4.</hi> ch. <hi>3.</hi> The Apology of the church of England part. <hi>4.</hi> p. <hi>123 124.</hi> &amp;c.</note> that he vvas not extraordinarily by internal inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons inſtructed and ſent by the ſpirit of God, as diuers of theſe men ſeeme plainely to affirme, (for the workes of God are perfect, and they whome he immediately ſendeth &amp; directeth in faith, erre not in any point of that argument) but that his inconſtant reaſon, was the principal ground on which he built his ſaid faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Secondly I adde, that the examples brought by <hi>Field</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of <hi>Luther,</hi> make nothing for his purpoſe. For what if <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>

vvriting, vvhen he was yet a nouice in Chriſtian religion, and not fully inſtructed, erred in ſome points; which errours ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued better inſtructions he reclaimed? What if the like happened to <hi>S. Ambroſe,</hi> being miraculouſly choſen to be a Biſhop and a teacher, before he was a Chriſtian? What if <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome articles of Chriſtian religion were ſo throughly diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and defined in the Church, as afterward vpon the riſing of new hereſies, ſpoke not ſo aptly and properly as was needful in ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding times, and therefore retracted what he had vttered? What if he and <hi>S. Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin</hi> in diuers matters diſputable and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Church, altered and corrected their former opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions? So hath Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> nowe done, who hath runne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the firſt ten tomes of his Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, and made as it were a booke of retractations, recalling ſuch thinges as he judged amiſſe. What I ſay if alſo theſe thinges be ſo, as without doubt they were no otherwiſe, ſhal it therefore be lawful for <hi>Luther</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other perſon to leape vp and downe, hither and thither, and to chop and change his faith according as his fancy leadeth him, in any articles of Chriſtian religion? verily I thinke, to no man of judgement ſuch a fault vvil ſeeme excuſable. But was <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> who as we haue ſeene ſo peremptorily reprehendeth <hi>Luther</hi> for his inconſtancy, him ſelfe free from this crime? Truly he vvas not: and becauſe breuity ſuffereth me not to runne through his works, and to ſhewe the change and alteration of his opinion concerning al particuler points, in vvhich he ſhewed himſelfe inconſtant, I wil only conuince him of inconſtancy touching one or two, and that by his owne confeſſion. It cannot be denied, but before his fal from vs he held the <hi>Catholike</hi> doctrine concerning the baptiſme of infants, otherwiſe, vvithout al doubt his nouelty vvould haue beene noted and cenſured. His firſt alteration therefore concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this matter, was from vs to <hi>Anabaptiſme;</hi> his ſecond from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſme</hi> in ſome ſort to our beliefe againe. That he was once an <hi>Anabaptist</hi> thus he confeſſeth. <hi>Wherefore, I my ſelfe alſo confeſſe frankely</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that a fewe yeares ſince, I being deceiued with this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, thought it better to deferre the baptiſme of young children, vntil they come to perfest age:</hi> thus <hi>Zwinglius.</hi> That he partly recanted after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this hereſie, he declareth in the ſame place: I ſay partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he alwaies denied the neceſſity of baptiſme to ſaluation. That
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:19127:190"/>
he was likewiſe inconſtant in his beliefe of the Euchariſt, theſe his owne wordes teſtifie:<note place="margin">Zwingl. tom. <hi>2.</hi> comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. de vera &amp; ſalſa religione, cap de Euchariſt. fol. <hi>202.</hi>

                     <hi>We haue written two yeares ſince of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, where we haue written many thinges rather according to the time, then the truth of the matter.</hi> And ſoone after: <hi>If</hi> (reader) <hi>thou finde certaine thinges here otherwiſe then in the former bookes, doe not thou wonder we would not giue foode out of ſeaſon, nor ſet pearls before ſwine.</hi> Finally, <hi>We retract therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and reuoke thoſe thinges which we haue ſaid there, in ſuch ſort that thoſe which we ſet forth in the two and fortith yeare of our age, counterpoiſe thoſe which we ſet forth in the fortith; when as we ſaid we ſerued more the time then the truth of the matter, that we might by that meanes the more edifie:</hi> thus <hi>Zwinglius</hi> of himſelfe. Who then can deny but he alſo was inconſtant, and at the leaſt in outward ſhewe altered his beliefe? yea, doth he not confeſſe to excuſe his inconſtancy, that ſometimes contrary to his owne conſcience and opinion? he oppugned the truth and ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced men with falſhood: truly this his owne wordes teſtify and it cannot be denied. But what doctrine doth he here recant? certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Luthers</hi> not ours. For he firſt fel from vs to <hi>Lutheraniſme,</hi> and defended <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion concerning the real preſence, but within fewe yeares profiting to the worſe, he became a <hi>Sacramentary,</hi> and affirmed the Euchariſt to be a bare figure only of the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt. Vnto theſe three I may very wel joine <hi>Iohn Caluin,</hi> as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man wil graunt that ſhal viewe the firſt edition of his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſet forth at <hi>Straſburge,</hi> where he profeſſed himſelfe firſt a <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran;</hi> and conferre it with the laſt editions of the ſame, and with other of his workes.</p>
                  <p>The diſciples and followers of theſe foure principal Captaines, moſt conſtantly followed the inconſtancy of their maſters. And firſt it is a ſtrange matter and almoſt incredible, howe wonderful inconſtant the <hi>Lutheran</hi> profeſſors of the confeſſion of <hi>Auſburge,</hi> haue alwaies ſhewed themſelues in their proceedinges. For the declaration of which I muſt giue my reader to vnderſtand, that this confeſſion aboue al others penned in thoſe daies by our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, was both permitted by the imperial lawes of <hi>Germany,</hi> in ſuch ſort as the profeſſors thereof were freed from al puniſhment by the lawes due vnto <hi>Heretikes,</hi> and alſo by diuers eſteemed as a fift Goſpel. Hence it proceeded, that al ſectaries of what newe ſect ſoeuer, profeſſed themſelues followers of this confeſſion. And
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:19127:190"/>
becauſe the wordes themſelues could not ſound wel on euery ſide, they added alſo their Commentaries vpon the ſame; and like as the ſentences of holy Scripture, ſo of this euery man endeauoured to drawe to his diuers fancies. Vnto this miſchiefe an other ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was adjoyned, to wit: the change and alteration of the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it ſelfe. For <hi>Melancthon</hi> the firſt penner of it, falling by litle and litle from <hi>Lutheraniſme</hi> to <hi>Zwinglianiſme,</hi> framed a newe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion according to his new faith, and publiſhed it vnder the name of the Confeſſion of <hi>Auſburge:</hi> Neither was this practiſed only by <hi>Melancthon,</hi> but alſo (as it ſeemeth) by others. Hence farther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſundry other contentions among the profeſſors of this newe faith, there aroſe no ſmal controuerſie euen among the <hi>Lutherans</hi> themſelues, who were the true followers of the Confeſſion of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſburge.</hi> And whoſoeuer is deſirous to ſee a part of this conflict, let him reade a booke intituled <hi>Colloquium Altenbergenſe,</hi> in which the acts and opinions of certaine <hi>Lutheran</hi> Diuines, vvhich mette in the ſaid towne for the deciſion of this matter and others, are ſet downe. And among other thinges in it he ſhal finde, not only their diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning the true copy or authentical edition of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: but alſo vnderſtand, that ſome of theſe diuines accuſed their fellowe <hi>Lutherans</hi> of <hi>Wittenberge,</hi> that they vvere <hi>miſerably tourned round like a wheele, in their faith;</hi> that <hi>they were as it were violently carried with contrary windes;</hi> and that <hi>they varied without end and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Confeſsions of their faith.</hi> This perhaps cauſed <hi>George</hi> that moſt noble Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> being demanded touching the newe ſectaries faith vvhat it vvas, to make anſwere; that he knewe very vvel vvhat they beleeued this yeare, but that it vvas impoſſible to knowe vvhat they vvould beleeue the next. This alſo moued the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Hiſtoriographers,<note place="margin">Centur. <hi>9.</hi> in praefat.</note> to tearme al the followers of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of <hi>Auſburge, Ecebolios;</hi> and to liken them to the fiſh <hi>Polipus</hi> or <hi>Pourcountrel,</hi> vvhich changeth often his colour; and to the old <hi>Pagan</hi> God <hi>Vertumnus,</hi> vvho could turne himſelfe into al ſhapes. They affirme finally, that they <hi>nowe approue the true doctrine, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after condemne the ſame; nowe calling that hereſie, which before they preached as an vnconquered truth:</hi> Thus farre the <hi>Centuriators.</hi> They might likewiſe haue added, that they embraced ſometimes that doctrine as true and euangelical, vvhich before they cenſured to be heretical. For an example of this their manner of proceeding
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19127:191"/>
vve haue from <hi>Dreſda</hi> in <hi>Miſina,</hi> vvhere in a Synode held <hi>anno</hi> 1571. certaine <hi>Lutherans</hi> condemned the opinion of <hi>Brentius</hi> and <hi>Illiricus</hi> their fellowes,<note place="margin">In lib. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiae.</note> concerning the perſon of Chriſt; vvhich opinion neuertheleſſe after ſome fewe yeares, to vvit: <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. they publikely embraced as true.

                     <hi>A lawe ouer hard</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is preſcribed to learned men, if after a proofe of their wit and learning publiſhed,</hi> it <hi>may not be lawful to them to profit any thing during their life:</hi> Thus <hi>Caluin.</hi> In which his diſcourſes, he doth not only confeſſe himſelfe, and his bretheren to haue beene inconſtant: but alſo ſeeketh a defence of this inconſtancy. But howe abſurdly he reaſoneth euery man of ſenſe may eaſily perceiue; for our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith and religion depend not (as he ſeemeth here to imagine) vpon the wit and learning of any man: neither is it lawful for any man be he neuer ſo vviſe or learned, to cal any one article by any meanes into doubt; for al the articles of our faith are reuealed by God, who is truth it ſelfe. But <hi>Caluin</hi> here plainely granteth, that he and his fellowes build their beliefe vpon their owne fancies and judgements, not vpon any certaine and infallible ground: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that they varie and alter the ſame according to their progreſſe in learning, and other motiues of their vnderſtanding, like as Philoſophers doe their opinions concerning matters of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy; indifferent, and doubtful. And this is the principal ground of our aduerſaries inconſtancy: Some other cauſes there may be aſſigned why they are inconſtant, to wit; that ſome of them make their temporal Princes their abſolute guides, and immediate heades in Eccleſiaſtical matters: wherefore, as often as vpon any conſideration of pollicy or any other reſpect, the Prince changeth his minde; ſo often alſo is religion altered. But whether this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in any man proceedeth from the authority of the Prince, or the judgement of the learned, or any other ſuch cauſe; certaine it is, that it argueth and proueth no certaine foundation of faith, to be
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:19127:192"/>
in him that ſo changeth. And beſides this, he doth alſo approue this or that belief or religion, becauſe for ſome one or other reſpect it pleaſeth his owne fancy. And like as theſe ſectaries, ſo vvere al the ancient <hi>Heretikes</hi> inconſtant, eſpecially the <hi>Arians;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Socrates lib. <hi>2.</hi> hiſt. ca. <hi>32.</hi>
                     </note> who as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> reporteth altered their Creede or forme of beliefe no leſſe then tenne times. Hence it proceedeth that none of theſe newe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries can euer be certaine, that they haue attained to the truth, and of this their inconſtancy is a moſt manifeſt argument. For I thinke that euery one of them, that haue changed his beliefe, vvil eaſily graunt that once he liued in errour. And it muſt be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that euery one altering, condemneth his former faith; vvhich if it be ſo, howe can ſuch men certainely knowe that they are not in errour ſtil? vvhat warrant haue they after their change, more then they had before? But beſides this reaſon, euery one of them hath other motiues to make him vncertaine of the truth of his owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to wit: that the moſt learned of his company, <hi>Luther,</hi> Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius, <hi>Caluin,</hi> and the reſt, haue erred; and conſequently, that he alſo may erre: that as wiſe and as learned men as he is himſelfe, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his beliefe to be falſe and erroneous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He that is vnlearned may alſo conſider, that if he build vpon the judgement of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he cannot poſſibly aſſure himſelfe that they doe not erre: yea, ſeing that euery one of them affirmeth his doctrine to be true, and yet they diſagree in faith, he may wel aſſure himſelfe that ſome of them doe erre; for contraries cannot both be true.</p>
                  <p>And howe can he certainely judge who followeth the truth, and who is guilty of errour? I adde likewiſe that he muſt needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that both <hi>Luther, Zwinglius,</hi> and al the principal ſectaries haue erred in ſome one point or other, (for I thinke that there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt no man that followeth either of them in al thinges:) howe then can any man be aſſured, that they haue not likewiſe erred in other articles, in which he followeth them? Surely a poſſibility of errour in one point, argueth a poſſibility of errour in al other of that kinde. But theſe matters haue beene touched before.</p>

then any interpreter of our age. In his daies there was no queſtion or doubt moued in the church, concerning the eſpecial points now in controuerſie betweene vs &amp; the new ſectaries; I meane touching the real preſence, juſtification and ſuch like points: wherefore he was a man indifferent, not partial of either ſide, but he followed that ſenſe which was then commonly approued by the conſent of the whole Church.

Hierome</hi> vvriteth as followeth: <hi>Only my countrieman</hi> Hierome <hi>was marueilous cunning in the tongues, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured to illuſtrate the Scriptures, both by his tranſlations and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries. But he indeed being ignorant of mans ſickneſſe, and Chriſt the phiſition, and wanting the key which openeth the Scripture, that is, the difference betweene the lawe and the Goſpel; being alſo deſtitute of Chriſt who openeth the dore, did litle good:</hi> hitherto are his vvordes. Of which it is manifeſt,<note n="d" place="margin">Illiricus in Claui part <hi>1.</hi> proefat.</note> that according to this <hi>Proteſtants</hi> judgement no skil in the tongues was wanting to this holy doctour. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I confeſſe, that the knowledge of the rule of faith beleeued in the Church, and the aſſiſtance of Chriſt and the holy Ghoſt are neceſſary to this, that a man truly tranſlate or interprete Scripture; yet I alſo firſt affirme, that any man of ſenſe wil rather yeeld theſe prerogatiues to <hi>S. Hierome</hi> a man ſo holy and auncient, then to any newe ſectary whatſoeuer. Secondly, I cannot ſee how according to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> grounds, theſe conditions or qualities can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>required in a tranſlator or interpreter of ſuch diuine bookes: for if the Scripture be the foundation and only rule of faith, as they
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:19127:194"/>
teach; and out of it only true beliefe is to be learned; how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but a man firſt beginning to tranſlate, read, or interprete Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, ſhal vvant true beliefe? Howe can Scripture be the only ground of our faith, and yet true faith be prerequired to the true tranſlation and interpretation of Scripture? Beſides this, out of the wordes of <hi>Illiricus</hi> alleaged it may wel be gathered, that no skil and knowledge of tongues ſufficeth to make a man a ſufficient tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlatour or expounder of Scripture, except vvithal his faith bee ſound, and he directed by <hi>Chriſt, who openeth the dore.</hi> Of which it vvil followe, ſeing that no man (as they ſay) before he readeth and vnderſtandeth Scripture can infallibly knowe, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe or any other is indued with ſuch faith, or hath ſuch aſſiſtance that no man can infallibly knowe his owne, or an other mans tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation to be true and ſincere. Verily, if the tranſlators faith muſt be judged by the conformity which it hath to holy Scripture (as it is by them affirmed) the Scripture muſt firſt be knowne before this conformity can be diſcerned, and howe can this be done by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned ſectary, ſeing that he cannot otherwiſe knowe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but by ſome tranſlator or interpreter? Of which may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, that the vnlearned ſectaries can neuer aſſure themſelues that any tranſlation is true: but of theſe matters before.</p>
               <p>For the authority alſo of our tranſlation in general, it maketh, that it hath beene read and allowed of in the Church aboue eleauen hundred yeares, and approued by thouſands of Saintes, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, and by them accepted as the true vvord of God.

For although vve both challenge to our ſelues the holy Scriptures, yet our tranſlation and interpretation is of greater authority then theirs. We alſo for the proofe of the ſenſe by vs receiued, offer to be tried by the cenſure of al our aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, from vvhome together with the letter, we haue receiued alſo that ſenſe which vve embrace: Contrariwiſe, they both in their tranſlation and expoſition, build onlie vpon their owne judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and haue no further proof or authority. And this I ſay is true, although we ſhould make the Church ſubject to errour, and grant the bare letter of Scripture to be the ground of our aduerſaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe. But as I haue proued, the authority of the Church is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible and diuine, and beſides this, the newe ſectaries build not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the letter of holy Scripture. Secondly I inferre of that which hath beene ſaid, that our aduerſaries according to their doctrine,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19127:196"/>
haue no infallible meane whereby to knowe what articles of faith haue beene reuealed by God to his Church, and conſequently, that they want a condition neceſſary to true faith. And this is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt both becauſe they make the Church (which God as I haue ſhewed, hath ordained to be the ordinary meane for vs to come to the knowledge of ſuch thinges) ſubject to error: and alſo becauſe the bare letter of Scripture vvhich they ordinarily pretend in this caſe, is inſufficient; neither doe they build vpon it as I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Thirdly I conclude, that abſolutely al the profeſſors of the newe Goſpel, ground their faith and religion vpon the judgement and fancy of man, not vpon any diuine authority. Hence they meaſure the omnipotent power of God by their owne weake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and in thoſe miſteries vvhich being aboue the reach of reaſon cannot be by it comprehended, they cry out vvith the <hi>Iewes; howe can this be?</hi>

ſtand vpon, either for Councels, Fathers, decrees or mens writings.</hi> And he addeth,<note place="margin">§ To end this point.</note> that he <hi>doth not doubt but ere long God wil raiſe vp ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of his glory, who ſhal fully diſcouer to the world this treachery of the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Church, by making it as apparent they haue corrupted the Fathers, as I hope</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to doe in this, and the bookes enſuing that they haue corrupted al ſuch late writers, as they imagined any way to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them:</hi> Thus <hi>Craſhaw.</hi> For the reſolution of which his falſe imputation, as alſo for clearing of our preſent practiſe, which may ſeeme to ſome to tend towardes the ouerthrow of the authority of antiquity; I thinke it not amiſſe to ſpend ſome fewe lines in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing theſe three points. Firſt, that our practiſe in correcting of bookes reprehended by <hi>Craſhaw,</hi> is prudent and laudable. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that our aduerſaries (if we offend in this) are much more to be condemned for the like proceedings in the ſame kinde. Laſtly, that the Fathers vvorkes are ſincere and free from al corruption. To declare the firſt, I muſt firſt giue my reader to vnderſtand, that the Church of Chriſt nowe hath and euer hath had, authority to cenſure and condemne al ſuch bookes as are publiſhed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thinges any vvaies oppoſite to the truth of her faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>This firſt appeareth, becauſe ſhe is ſupreame judge on earth of al controuerſies ariſing touching faith and religion, and hath juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ouer euery Chriſtian; from which it proceedeth that ſhe condemneth hereſies and <hi>Heretikes:</hi> wherefore it cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſhe hath alſo authority to condemne the works of any <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike,</hi> or other perſon vvhatſoeuer containing hereſies or errours oppoſite to her faith. For much more it is to condemne an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike,</hi> or an hereſie, then to condemne an heretical or erroneous booke.</p>
            <p>Secondly, authority to doe this was needful, for the preſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one true faith and religion in the Church: for vvhat is more daungerous to infect true Chriſtian harts, then bad bookes? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they be not knowne and cenſured to be ſuch, but read by al ſorts indifferently; as <hi>Catholike</hi> and Orthodoxal.

            <p>Nowe, ſeing the Church hath authority to condemne or burne heretical bookes, or others that containe falſe doctrine oppoſite to the rule of faith; no man of any judgement wil deny, but ſhee hath alſo authority to correct them, if by that means ſhe can make them profitable for her vſe, and beneficial to her children: For much leſſe it is to correct, then to condemne and burne; and much better it is in ſuch caſes to correct, then cleane to aboliſh. Hence are theſe wordes of <hi>S. Hierome</hi> ſpeaking of the vvorkes of <hi>Origen:</hi>

            <p>But yet to deſcend a litle lower, what bookes may we correct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our rules, and of what antiquity? none certainely of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Catholikes,</hi> but ſuch as liued ſince the yeare one thouſand fiue hundred and fifteene, vvhich vvas the ſecond yeare before <hi>Luther</hi> beganne to fal from vs, beſides a fewe other expreſly named in our Index of forbidden bookes. And of ſuch named authours more ancient then <hi>Luther</hi> howe many haue we <hi>de facto</hi> corrected? Verily I doe not thinke that <hi>Craſhaw</hi> can bring forth ſo much as one. True it is that he vſeth theſe wordes:<note place="margin">In the Epiſtle dedicatory fol. <hi>2.</hi>

               <hi>We produce the authours that liued and wrote long before</hi> Luther, <hi>but we finde them ſo raſed and altered, as ſome that ſpake for vs, are nowe ſilent; yea ſome that made for vs, are nowe against vs:</hi> Thus he.

               <note place="margin">Prologo. E. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> for (as I haue ſaid) I thinke that he can hardly name one authour that vve haue corrected of any age before <hi>Luthers.</hi> I can as yet find but one named throughout his booke, vvhich vvas of the age immediately before <hi>Luthers</hi> departure from vs, (and whether he be corrected or no I know not) neuertheleſſe this is one of the two hundred yeares.

               </note> but it is more then euer I ſawe or heard.

the yeare 1515. but are named in our Index, and beſides theſe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be touched. Neither are al theſe corrected for hereſie, as wil appeare to the reader by ſuch rules as are to be obſerued in the correction, of which more hereafter, but they are partly ſet downe by <hi>Craſhaw</hi> towardes the end of his <hi>Prolegomena.</hi> I cannot finally but note,<note place="margin">Prolegom. E. <hi>3.</hi> Geſnerus in Bibliotheca.</note> that he calleth <hi>Ferus an old and famous writer,</hi> who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne confeſſion vvas liuing vvithin theſe threeſcore yeares: nay I thinke it may be proued out of <hi>Geſnerus</hi> that he died not forty yeares ſince, but to ſaue this he addeth in the margent, that he meaneth old in compariſon of the <hi>Ieſuites, who nowe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>carry al before them; for he was in the eare, when they were in the blade.</hi> This is his marginal note, by which he ſaueth but il the truth of the text, let his meaning be as it wil; for the religion of the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> beganne about the yeare 1521. And was confirmed by <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> 3. <hi>Pope</hi> about the yeare 1540. long before <hi>Ferus</hi> died by his owne confeſſion. And this it ſeemeth he wel knewe; for it may plainely be gathered out of his preface, that the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> were before the end of the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> vvhich neuertheleſſe vvas in the yeare 1563.</p>
            <p>But to cleare vs further from al blame touching this point, I muſt alſo adde this in our defence; that this our manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is neither to the end to bereaue our aduerſaries of any proofe, which our aduerſaries may bring out of antiquity, or any moderne author for the truth of their religion, nor to ſtrengthen our cauſe. For although I ſhould yeeld, that al the authors whome <hi>Craſhaw</hi> nameth vvere <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (vvhich yet he confeſſeth to be falſe, for he granteth they were al <hi>Catholikes,</hi>) what ſhould I in effect helpe their cauſe, or weaken ours? ſuppoſe ſome named that liued before <hi>Luther</hi> held ſome opinions, with <hi>Wickliffe, Hierome</hi> of <hi>Prage,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Huſſe;</hi> what is this to vs? Doe vve build our faith vpon the particular opinions of ſome fewe priuate men, or doe vve proue the truth of our doctrine by their teſtimonies? Moreouer, ſuppoſe ſome followed thoſe men in ſome one or two opinions, were they preſently in al other points <hi>Proteſtants?</hi> or doth it proue the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> religion true?<note place="margin">Treatiſe of the definition and notes of the Church.</note> Nothing leſſe: for as I vvil ſhewe hereafter, neither <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> nor <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Prage,</hi> nor <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> were <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> much leſſe any that were in open profeſſion <hi>Catholikes.</hi> But in very deed, the Church doth not only in moderne authours cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:19127:203"/>
propoſitions that are in plaine tearmes heretical, but alſo (as appeareth by our rules related by <hi>Craſhaw</hi>) ſuch as be erroneous, taſte of hereſie, are offenſiue to godly eares, or temerarious; yea ſuch as are vvanton, or diſhoneſt, ſuperſtitious, tending to the infamy of any, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as I wil declare anone.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, if our intention were to make the authors ſeeme al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ours, and to take them as it vvere from the Sectaries whoſe doctrine they ſeeme to approue; vvhat reaſon haue vve to publiſh in print to the whole world, what we wil haue corrected in their workes? Is not this a plaine confeſſion, that we diſlike their manner of ſpeach, or their doctrine? Wherefore, in this we rather helpe our aduerſaries cauſe, if the authority of the ſaid authors be of any moment, then weaken it. And in very truth, if vve did it to any ſuch end as they intend, it were no wiſedome to make our doinges knowne to the world, but much more policy we ſhould ſhewe, if vve did it in priuate and neuer made any open mention of it but rather did denie it. Why then doe we correct ſuch bookes? in very truth as is apparant, for no other cauſes then I haue partly rehearſed before, to wit: principally that one faith and religion may be preſerued among al ſorts, and that no man embrace any doctrine as approued or tollerated in the Church, which is not ſo approued and tollerated; then alſo to auoid al ſuperſtition, witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, corruption of manners, and other ſuch vices as wil appeare by the rules, of which hereafter.</p>
            <p>But they ſay that vve take vpon vs to correct <hi>Bertramus,</hi> an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour vvho liued in the Church 700. yeares ſince, and <hi>Rampegolus</hi> who flouriſhed in the yeare 1418. I anſwere that vve neither doe this to bereaue our aduerſaries of any teſtimony; for as concerning <hi>Bertramus,</hi> vve commonly graunt that booke vvhich goeth vnder his name, to make for their doctrine againſt the real preſence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſeeme to denie it: nay further,<note place="margin">See the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury writers, Centur. <hi>9.</hi> c. <hi>4</hi> col. <hi>212.</hi>
               </note> many of the beſt learned men of our ſide, acknowledge alſo in their publike vvritings the booke to be his (<note n="*" place="margin">Pantaleon in Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphia, p. <hi>65</hi>

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:19127:204"/>
them the good. <hi>Rampegolus</hi> is nothing like ſo auncient, and beſides it is confeſſed by <hi>Poſsiuinus</hi> that his booke being written in a time not oppugned by ſuch hereſies as ſince are riſen,<note place="margin">Poſsiuin. to. <hi>1.</hi> apparat. q. ſacr. pag. <hi>114. 115.</hi>
               </note> containeth ſome errours: vvherefore neither doe vve endeauour to conceale, that in ſome points he ſeemeth to fauour our aduerſaries. He addeth, that this authour hath put into his vvorke certaine abſurd thinges, or rather fables out of the maſter of the Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, that he hath many thinges otherwiſe then they are in the Bible, that the Scripture is not cited ſo ſincerely, yea that ſometimes it is alleaged falſly, that he hath ſome thinges Apocryphal out of the 3. booke of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> and out of the epiſtle of <hi>Ciril of</hi> Hieruſalem <hi>to</hi> S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, <hi>concerning the death of</hi> S. <hi>Hierome.</hi> Beſides this, he accuſeth him of falſe allegations of Doctors, of Soleciſmes, Barbariſmes, and obſcure phraſes. And ſeing that it is a booke vvhich young preachers would much vſe if it were not forbidden, and that as it is like without choice of the good from the badde, for want of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I hope no man wil blame vs if we amend that which is amiſſe. And thus much of the firſt point. Nowe to come to the ſecond point, I muſt needes returne <hi>M. Craſhawes</hi> argument vpon himſelfe thus: They who raze <hi>the recordes</hi> and falſify <hi>the monuments of mens writings, altering the bookes of learned men after they are dead, adding, and taking out at their pleaſures, and namely taking out ſuch wordes, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and whole diſcourſes as make againſt them, and adding the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry euen whatſoeuer they can imagine to make for them,</hi> incurre <hi>no leſſe crime then corruption and forgery in the higheſt degree.</hi> This is gathered out of <hi>Craſhaw</hi> in the ſecond page of his epiſtle Dedicatory: But the followers of the newe religion, who are called <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> haue done ſo; therefore they haue incurred the crime of corruption or forgery in the higheſt degree. <hi>M. Craſhaw</hi> muſt pardon me if I proceede not in forme of lawe by accuſation, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and proofe as he doth, becauſe I haue neuer yet bin <hi>preacher at the Temples.</hi> The proofe of my minor propoſition if I ſhould runne through authours vvhich they haue corrupted, citing the vvordes and ſentences left out or added, would riſe to a great vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume: vvherefore briefly, only I accuſe them of corrupting after this ſort, the hiſtory of <hi>Sigonius de regno Italiae;</hi> of <hi>Oſorius de rebus gestis Emanuëlis Regis;</hi> and of <hi>Castineda</hi> who ſupplied that which wanted for ſome yeares after <hi>Oſorius</hi> ended, of the liues of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:19127:204"/>
and diuers others. And for the proofe of this, to the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſectaries I accuſe our <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants,</hi> for corrupting S. Auguſtines <hi>meditations,</hi> his <hi>praiers,</hi> and <hi>Manuel;</hi> The <hi>Meditations</hi> of <hi>Granada</hi> printed in the yeare 1602. The <hi>conuerſion</hi> of <hi>a ſinner,</hi> the <hi>imitation of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Christian directory,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid, that in the beginning of the bookes this correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or alteration is confeſſed. I reply, that ſo likewiſe in our <hi>Indices expurgatorij,</hi> and alſo commonly in the beginning of ſuch bookes as vve correct, we acknowledge the correction: but doe they this in al their workes? ſurely no. And for example I name the meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Granada,</hi> in which there is no mention of any alteration; for they are plainely ſet forth in his name, as though they vvere truly and ſincerely his, whereas the tranſlator or rather the falſifier or corrupter hath left out vvhole diſcourſes, yea I may almoſt ſay whole meditations, and added what pleaſeth himſelfe to make him ſpeake like a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> Neither doe they deale only ſo with vs, but alſo vvith their owne bretheren, and that ſometimes in principal matters. For example, the <hi>Lutheran Proteſtants</hi> in their conference or ſynode held at <hi>Altenburge,</hi> accuſe one another for corrupting and falſifying the <hi>Confeſsion</hi> of <hi>Auſburge,</hi> which is the very ground next vnto the holy Scripture of their faith and religion.<note place="margin">Colloquium Altenberg. fol. <hi>402.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>The former copies or examplars</hi> (ſay they) <hi>haue not the true and ſincere confeſsion of</hi> Auſburge. <hi>For there is another ſubſtituted or put in the place of it, which was neither exhibited at</hi> Auſburge, <hi>or euer approued by the ſtates of the Confeſsion of Auſburge:</hi> Thus they. And vpon the corruption of this Confeſſion, and of an other booke called <hi>Corpus doctrinae,</hi> contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this, and other treateſies, aroſe great diſcord and diſſention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, vvhich is not yet ended: for no man almoſt can tel vvhich be the true bookes. But what diſſention was there among them in the ſame conference touching <hi>Luthers</hi> vvorkes corrupted? verily the zealous <hi>Lutherans</hi> complaine after this ſort:<note n="*" place="margin">

Verily <hi>Weſtphalus</hi> a <hi>Lutheran</hi> accuſeth the <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> euen of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place, that they haue corrupted <hi>Luthers</hi> vvorkes; for thus he complaineth. I maruaile much that <hi>Caluin</hi> keeping ſuch adoe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this one word, could not ſee the moſt filthy mutations and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, of the diuine commentary of Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> vpon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and tranſlated into <hi>French</hi> and printed at <hi>Geneua.</hi> In one place ſome wordes are taken away, in an other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moe: ſomewhere whole Paragraphs are lopt off: in the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſixt Chapter, two pages and a halfe are left out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times they haue put in vvordes ſuch as pleaſed them. And that this was done at <hi>Geneua</hi> without <hi>Caluins</hi> knowledge it is not very likely: Thus <hi>Weſtphalus.</hi> But let vs heare an other man of more credit among <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> make the like complaint, that by the teſtimony of two witneſſes they may be proued falſifiers: <hi>M. Morton</hi> a famous <hi>Proteſtant</hi> writer of this realme nowe liuing, ſet forth in <hi>London</hi> in the yeare 1605. the firſt part of his vvorke called by him a <hi>Catholike Apologie.</hi> But what did they of <hi>Geneua?</hi> They printed againe the ſaid booke in their City, putting the name of <hi>London</hi> to it, as though it had beene there printed, and diſliking a certaine anſwere by him made in defence of <hi>Beza,</hi> they put that out, and vvithout any more adoe in place of it added an other of their owne. This I proue out of <hi>M. Mortons</hi> owne wordes, vvho in certaine animaduerſions vpon this firſt part, printed at the end of the ſecond part publiſhed at <hi>London</hi> in the ſame yeare, ſpeaking of the ſame matter complaineth thus. <hi>C.</hi> 21. <hi>in calumnia</hi> 5. <hi>Noua im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsio</hi> Londini <hi>dicta, ver'e</hi> Geneuae <hi>facta, totum responſum meum pro</hi> Beza <hi>penitus expunxit, &amp; responſum ſuum aſſuit (prob hominum fidem) doleo equidem tantam cum ſcriptis meis injuriam factam eſſe, tum etiam proelo</hi> Geneuenſi <hi>tantam corruptelae labem contractam.

The bookes of other</hi> Heretikes <hi>alſo which treate</hi> ex profeſſo <hi>of religion</hi> (that is whoſe principal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of religion) <hi>are altogether forbidden. But ſuch as treate not of religion, examined by the commandement of Biſhops, and Inquiſitours, by</hi> Catholike <hi>diuines, and approued, are permitted:</hi> hitherto are the wordes of the rule. Out of which it is manifeſt, that <hi>M. Craſhaw</hi> by placing the word <hi>(Heretikes)</hi> in the place of the word <hi>Archere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes,</hi> hath falſified the ſaid rule, and turned it to a cleane contrary ſenſe. For vvhereas the rule ſaith, that certaine bookes of ſome <hi>Heretikes</hi> are permitted, he maketh it ſay the bookes of <hi>Heretikes</hi> vnder what name, title, or argument whatſoeuer, are prohibited. And this (as it may ſeeme) he doth to perſwade his reader that vve are ſo ſtrict in this matter, that we ſuffer not any bookes whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vvritten by <hi>Heretikes</hi> be they neuer ſo profitable, to be read; which is falſe: this is one corruption ſo palpable that it cannot be denied. I vvil not vrge that in the third rule he nameth <hi>Iunius</hi> his tranſlation of the old teſtament, and <hi>Bezaes</hi> of the newe; whereas theſe authours or their tranſlations are not ſo much as named in the rule, as it is found in our bookes. And for breuities ſake I come to his reherſal of our inſtructions, for the purging and correction of bookes. Before he ſetteth downe ſuch thinges as are to be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, tranſlating that vvhich is ſaid in our bookes before ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions as are giuen, he ſaith: <hi>And ſuch thinges as doe require cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or purgation are theſe:</hi> And then he beginneth to rehearſe what our <hi>Index</hi> willeth to be corrected, but ſo falſely as he may be very wel aſhamed of his dealing, For vvhereas the inſtruction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, that al thinges that <hi>taſte of ſuperſtion, witchcraft, or diuina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be rejected;</hi> likewiſe <hi>that al be blotted out that make mans free-wil ſubject to deſtiny, falſe or deceitful ſignes, or Ethnicke fortune:</hi> and that <hi>ſuch thinges as ſauour of</hi> Paganiſme <hi>be aboliſhed;</hi> that <hi>jeſts, or merry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits &amp; quips toſſed to the hurt or prejudice of the fame and credit of others, be abandoned;</hi> that <hi>thinges wanton and diſhoneſt which may corrupt good manners, be remoued;</hi> finally, that <hi>vnſeemely and diſhoneſt pictures be defaced:</hi> he leaueth out al this, and that vvithout al doubt to make his reader beleeue, that vve correct bookes for no other matters, but to make them agree vvith vs in religion. And to this end, it may be imagined, that before he left out the ſeauenth and ninth

Touching our prohibition of certaine bookes I adde only, that in like manner as we forbidde their bookes, and ſuffer them not to be read of al ſorts: ſo they forbid ours, as their ſtatutes teſtifie; and for this alſo are more to be blamed then we; that our bookes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by them, maintaine and defend an old religion, taught and left vs by our forefathers; theirs forbidden by vs, a new deuiſed in this laſt age by <hi>Luther,</hi> Caroloſtadius, Zwinglius, <hi>Caluin,</hi> and ſuch companions.</p>
            <p>I wil diſpatch the laſt point in fewe wordes; wherefore to proue that the Fathers are not by vs corrupted, I bring theſe three briefe reaſons. Firſt, this our practiſe of making ſuch <hi>Indices expurgatorij</hi> hath beene but very late, as <hi>Craſhaw</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth in thoſe his wordes: <hi>Long was the mother Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in breeding her</hi> Indices expurgatorios; <hi>at laſt ſhee brought them out,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Craſhaw in the begi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning of his preface to the reader.</note> 
               <hi>or rather ſome politike Ieſuites conceiued them, the Fathers of</hi> Trent <hi>bare them, and the</hi> Pope <hi>brought them out:</hi> thus <hi>Craſhaw.</hi> Out of which it is manifeſt, that we vſed no ſuch <hi>Indices</hi> before the Councel of <hi>Trent.</hi> And hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth an other reaſon, to wit: that there was neuer any general rule or order ſet downe by the Church, for correcting any one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers workes: this is manifeſt, becauſe had the Church taken order for any ſuch matters, there can be no doubt made, but ſuch ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alſo as fauour <hi>Millinariſme,</hi> Arianiſme, <hi>Donatiſme,</hi> Neſtorianiſme, and other ſuch like hereſies, vvhich in thoſe daies oppoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt the Church, had beene put out, rather then ſuch as
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:19127:208"/>
our aduerſaries pretend made for them; ſeing that we can finde no recordes that any of their ſort oppoſed themſelues in thoſe times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. Further, the art of printing bookes vvas vnknowne at the leaſt to our part of the vvorld, before the yeare of our Lord 1440. as al hiſtories of that age teſtifie: wherefore, the workes of the Fathers before thoſe daies were written by diuers perſons, and in diuers places, by diuers men that knewe not vvhat one another did, which copies are yet extant. Of which I inferre, that except ſome general rule for al had beene preſcribed, it had beene impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that they ſhould haue al conſpired to haue corrupted the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by adding or detracting the ſelfe ſame wordes; and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe we ſee, that al the written copies of the Fathers workes agree &amp; conteine the ſame ſentences: much leſſe could we haue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Fathers workes, if thoſe of our ſide were only a faction and diuers in faith agreeing vvith our aduerſaries who alwaies op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelues againſt vs, or at the leaſt ſecretly retained their belief as <hi>Field</hi> affirmeth;<note place="margin">Field booke <hi>3</hi> of the Church chap. <hi>6. 7. 8.</hi>
               </note> for then it is like that ſome of them preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Fathers workes from corruption. Finally this openeth the way to the <hi>Zwenckfeldians</hi> &amp; <hi>Libertines,</hi> who reject al Scriptures; for of the corruption of the Fathers a man may wel inferre the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption alſo of them: neither can theſe by better reaſon be freed from ſuch an imputation then thoſe.
