1. THE FIRST PART. OF THE GROVNDES OF THE OLD RELIGION.

    _ Chap. the firſt. Of the firſt ground of Catholike religion, to wit: that there is a God, and that God by his prouidence, gouerneth al thinges.

      * SECTION THE FIRST. That there is a God.

      * SECTION THE SECOND. Almighty God hath care of worldly affaires, and ruleth al thinges by his diuine prouidence.

      * SECTION THE FIRST.

      * SECTION THE SECOND. That faith is a most firme aſſent of the vnderſtanding.

      * SECTION THE THIRD. Faith is of thinges incomprehenſible by natural reaſon, and conſequently obſcure.

      * SECTION THE FOVRTH. By true Christian faith we beleeue ſuch miſteries, as God hath reuealed to his Church.

      * SECTION THE FIFT. That true faith is built vpon diuine authority.

      * SECTION THE SIXT. Beſides the reuelation of God, ſome infallible propounder of the articles of our faith is neceſſary: and that they are propounded vnto vs by the Catholike Church.

      * SECTION THE FIRST.

      * SECTION THE SECOND. The whole ſumme of Christian doctrine (by word of mouth, not by writing) was committed by Christ to his Apostles.

      * SECTION THE THIRD. The Church cannot ſtray from the rule of faith receaued, nor erre in matters of faith or general precepts of manners, which is proued first, becauſe the holy Ghoſt directeth her in al truth.

      * SECTION THE FOVRTH. The ſame is proued by other arguments.

      * SECTION THE FIFT. That the teſtimonies of holy Scripture, and other proofes brought for the infallible and diuine authority of the Church, cannot be applied to the Church, conſidered as it comprehendeth al faithful Chriſtians, that are and haue beene ſince Chriſtes aſcenſion, or ſince the Apostles daies: but vnto the preſent Church of al ages.

      * SECTION THE SIXT. That the ſame teſtimonies and proofes, conuince an infallible judgement of the Church concerning euery article of faith, not only concerning certaine of the principal.

      * SECTION THE SEAVENTH. That to ſaluation it is neceſſary to beleeue the whole Catholike faith, and euery article thereof.

      * SECTION THE FIRST. Howe the Scripture is knowne to be Canonical.

      * SECTION THE SECOND. Concerning the ſenſe or expoſition of holy Scriptures; and firſt that the Scriptures are hard, and receiue diuers interpretations.

      * SECTION THE THIRD. The Scriptures may be falſly vnderſtood: and that euery priuate man may erre in the vnderſtanding of them.

      * SECTION THE FOVRTH. That the letter of holy Scripture falſly interpreted, is not the word of God.

      * SECTION THE FIFT. The true ſenſe of the holy Scriptures, is to be learned of the Catholike Church, who is the true judge thereof.

      * SECTION THE SIXT. An objection againſt the premiſes is anſwered, and the queſtion concerning the laſt reſolution of our faith is diſcuſſed.

      * SECTION THE FIRST. Of Apoſtolike Tradition in general.

      * SECTION THE SECOND. Of vnwritten Traditions in particular.

      * SECTION THE FIRST. Containing a briefe explication or rehearſal of the Catholike doctrine, concerning the Popes ſupremacie.

      * SECTION THE SECOND. The aforeſaid doctrine is proued.

      * SECTION THE THIRD. That the decrees of the Biſhop of Rome, when he teacheth the Church as ſupreame Paſtour, are of diuine and infallible authority; and of ſome other groundes of faith, flowing out of theſe.

      * SECTION THE FOVRTH. The opinion of ſome ſectaries that the Pope is Antechriſt, is brieflie confuted: and two objections againſt the premiſes are anſwered.

      * SECTION THE FIRST. The number of Atheiſts among them is great, and of the cauſes by them giuen of this impiety.

      * SECTION THE SECOND. Of our aduerſaries doctrine concerning the immortallity of the ſoule, heauen and hel.

      * SECNION THE THIRD. Of our aduerſaries impious aſsertions concerning Chriſt, and Chriſtian religion.

      * SECTION THE FOVRTH. That in like ſort they weaken the principal proofes of the ſaid three groundes.

      * SEGTION SHE FIRST. In which this is proued, becauſe by Scripture the Scripture it ſelfe cannot be proued Canonical. It is alſo argued, that according to the ſectaries groundes there is no Canonical Scripture, and ſome principal reaſons (eſpecially inſpiration of the ſpirit) which they alleage for the proofe of ſuch Scripture, are refelled.

      * SECTION THE SECOND. In which the ſame argument is proſecuted, and two thinges principallie are proued. Firſt, that the newe Teſtament receiueth ſmal authority (if we beleeue our aduerſaries) by this that it was written by the Apoſtles and Diſciples, becauſe they accuſe them of errour. Secondlie becauſe they confeſſe the text of Scripture to be corrupted.

      * SECTION THE THIRD. The ſame is proued, becauſe euery Chriſtian is bound to admit and beleeue certaine propoſitions, neither expreſly contained, nor (according to ſome mens judgements) ſo euidently gathered out of the holy Scripture.

      * SECTION THE FOVRTH. The inſufficiency of the bare letter of holy Scripture is proued by other arguments, eſpecially by this; that the true interpretation cannot be infallibly gathered out of the letter.

      * SECTION THE FIRST. In which this is firſt proued concerning al their Bibles in general.

      * SECTION THE SECOND. That Luther, Zwinglius, Caluin, and Beza, in particular haue corruptly tranſlated the Scriptures.

      * SECTION THE THIRD. Our Engliſh Sectaries alſo, haue falſly and corruptly tranſlated the Scriptures.

      * SECTION THE FOVRTH. Containing falſe tranſlations againſt the authority of the Church, Traditions, honour of Images, Purgatory, and the honour of Saints.

      * SECTION THE FIFT. Of their corruptions againſt inherent Iuſtice, Iustification by good workes, Merit of good workes, and keeping the Commandements, and in defence of their ſpecial Faith, vaine Security, &c. and againſt Freewil, and Merits.

      * SECTION THE SIXT. Of their falſe tranſlations againſt the Real preſence, Prieſt-hood, election of Biſhops, ſingle life of Prieſts, Penance, and ſatisfaction for Sinne; the Sacrament of Matrimony, and ſome other points.

      * SECTION THE SEAVENTH. That the Profeſſors of the newe religion in corrupting the Scriptures, followe the ſteps of the auncient Heretikes, and what followeth of this diſcourſe.

      * SECTION THE FIRST. In which this is proued; firſt, becauſe the propoſitions (which they tearme of their faith) are not in expreſſe tearmes contained in the Scripture.

      * SECTION THE SECOND. The ſame argument is confirmed by the teſtimonie of ſome Proteſtants, concerning the true ſenſe of ſome wordes of Scripture, alleaged for our Catholike doctrine touching juſtification in the Section before.

      * SECTION THE THIRD. The like diſcourſe is made concerning a place of Scripture alleaged for the real preſence.

      * SECTION THE FOVRTH. The followers of the newe religion in diuers matters obſerue not the letter of their owne Bibles.

      * SECTION THE FIRST. In which this is proued by their doctrine and diſſention concerning the bookes of Canonical Scripture, and their altering of the text of the ſame.

      * SECTION THE SECOND. The ſame is confirmed by their tranſlations, and expoſitions, of holy Scripture.

      * SECTION THE THIRD. Concerning the newe expoſition of thoſe wordes, This is my body, in particular.

      * SECTION THE FOVRTH. That certaine rules preſcribed by Field for the true vnderſtanding of Scripture, of themſelues alone without the cenſure of the Church, are inſufficient to aſſure vs, that our expoſition made, is of diuine truth.

      * SECTION THE FIFT. Concerning their deductions out of holy Scripture: that they likewiſe are framed by them according to their owne fancies; and of their accuſations of one another touching theſe matters.

      * SECTION THE SIXT. The vnlearned and ignorant ſectaries, in receiuing and expounding the holy Scriptures, likewiſe build vpon their owne fancies and judgements, and haue no other ground of their faith and religion.

      * SECTION THE SEAVENTH. Of the miſerable estate of the vnlearned and ignorant Sectaries.

      * SECTION THE EIGHT. That the newe ſectaries alleage Scriptures to confirme their newe doctrine, it is no certaine argument that they build their faith and religion vpon the ſaid Scriptures.

      * SECTION THE FIRST. Concerning their flying to other groundes by themſelues rejected, and their diſſenſion.

      * SECTION THE SECOND. Concerning the inconſtancy of the Profeſſors of the newe religion.

    _ Chapter 2. Of the ſecond ground of our religion, to wit: that the ſoule of man is immortal, and that it ſhal either be rewarded euerlaſtingly in heauen, or puniſhed euerlaſtingly in hel.

      * SECTION THE SECOND. Almighty God hath care of worldly affaires, and ruleth al thinges by his diuine prouidence.
